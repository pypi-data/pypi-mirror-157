class VectorSizeNormaliser(Unsupervised, FeaturePreprocessor):
    """
    Rescales each instance (seen as a vector) to a fixed size.
    Typically used on datasets of frequency counts,
    when only the relative frequencies are considered important,
    e.g. token counts of texts in NLP.

    Parameters
    ----------
    measure: str or float or (np.array -> float) = 'boscovich'
        The vector size measure to use. Must be positively homogeneous.
        A float is interpreted as Minkowski size with the corresponding value for `p`.
        For convenience, a number of popular measures can be referred to by name.

    target_size: float = 0.5
        The size that all vectors will be rescaled to.
        The default, 0.5, ensures that for Minkowski sizes,
        the maximum distance in the resulting dataset is 1.
        A more typical choice is to set this value to 1,
        so that all instances end up on the unit hypersphere.

    Notes
    -----
    If the size of an instance is 0, it will be left unscaled.
    If the size of an instance is âˆž, it will be scaled to 0.
