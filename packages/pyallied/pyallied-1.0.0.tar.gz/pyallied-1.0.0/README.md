    Simulates typing into the element.

    Args:	
    value - A string for typing, or setting form fields. For setting file inputs, this could be a local file path.
    Use this to send simple key events or to fill out form fields:
    form_textfield = driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'username')
                    form_textfield.send_keys("admin")
    This can also be used to set file inputs.

    file_input = driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'profilePic')
    file_input.send_keys("path/to/profilepic.gif")
    # Generally it's better to wrap the file path in one of the methods
    # in os.path to return the actual path to support cross OS testing.
    # file_input.send_keys(os.path.abspath("path/to/profilepic.gif"))

        Gets the given attribute or property of the element.

        This method will first try to return the value of a property with the given name. If a property with that name doesn’t exist, it returns the value of the attribute with the same name. If there’s no attribute with that name, None is returned.

        Values which are considered truthy, that is equals “true” or “false”, are returned as booleans. All other non-None values are returned as strings. For attributes or properties which do not exist, None is returned.

        To obtain the exact value of the attribute or property, use get_dom_attribute() or get_property() methods respectively.

        Args:	
        name - Name of the attribute/property to retrieve.
        Example:

        # Check if the "active" CSS class is applied to an element.
        is_active = "active" in target_element.get_attribute("class")
