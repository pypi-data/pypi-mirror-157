# This file contains pip package version constraints that are needed to ensure
# compatibility across the 4 main requirements files.
#
# This should only be used when we have an indirect dependency version clash
# (direct dependency clashes should be addressed in the requirements files).
#
# These should be checked regularly to see if they are still required.

# This a direct dependency but the clash is due to another dependency chain so
# easier to mark the limit in here so it can be removed and checked easily.
# There are incompatible versions in the resolved dependencies:
#   protobuf==4.21.0 (from -c requirements.txt (line 191))
#   protobuf>=3.7.0 (from mlflow==1.26.0->-r requirements-test.in (line 36))
#   protobuf<4.0dev,>=3.12.0 (from wandb==0.12.17->-r requirements-test.in (line 39))
protobuf<4.0.0
