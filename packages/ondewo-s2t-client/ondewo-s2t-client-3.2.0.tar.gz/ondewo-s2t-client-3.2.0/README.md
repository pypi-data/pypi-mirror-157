ONDEWO-S2T Client Library
======================

This library facilitates the interaction between a user and an ONDEWO-S2T server instance. 

It is structured around a series of python files generated from protobuf files. These protobuf files specify the details of the interface, and can be used to generate code in 10+ high-level languages. They are found in the [apis submodule](ondewo-s2t-api).

Python Installation
-------------------

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ondewo/ondewo-s2t-client-python.git
cd ondewo-s2t-client-python

```
