# pybuild-header-dependency

`pybuild-header-dependency` is a helper package to resolve C/C++ header-only libraries for Python build with native extensions.

# Why this project?

# Installation

You rarely need to install it manually. If you do, you can directly install it from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pybuild-header-dependency
```

# Usage

## Build dependency

## Get headers

## Limitation

As the name of this project suggests, this project supports header-only C/C++ libraries.
If you project depends on some static/dynamic libraries, you need to use a full build system like `cmake`.

The default way of downloading packages from GitLab/GitHub is based on releases.
