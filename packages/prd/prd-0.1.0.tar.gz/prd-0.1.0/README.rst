Purpose
-------

.. |sum| replace:: ``sum``
.. _sum: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum

.. |math_sum| replace:: ``math.sum``
.. _math_sum: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.prod

.. |functools_reduce| replace:: ``functools.reduce``
.. _functools_reduce: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce

.. |mul| replace:: ``__mul__``
.. _mul: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__mul__

A built-in product function that would complement the |sum|_ function was `rejected <https://bugs.python.org/issue1093>`__, and the built-in |math_sum|_ function does not accept iterables that contain values of non-numeric types. This library exports an idiomatic implementation (using |functools_reduce|_) of a product function that can operate on iterables that contain objects of any type for which the multiplication operation is defined (*e.g.*, via a definition of the |mul|_ method). 

Installation and Usage
----------------------
This library is available as a `package on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/prd>`__::

    python -m pip install prd

The library can be imported in the usual ways::

    import prd
    from prd import prd

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. |operator_mul| replace:: ``operator.mul``
.. _operator_mul: https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.mul

This library exports an idiomatic implementation of a product function (an analog of -- and complement to -- the built-in |sum|_ function). This function applies the built-in multiplication operator |operator_mul|_ to all of the items from the supplied iterable::

    >>> prd([1, 2, 3, 4])
    24
    >>> prd([2])
    2
    >>> prd([1.2, 3.4, 5.6])
    22.848
    >>> prd([])
    1

The function is compatible with objects for which the built-in multiplication operator is defined::

    >>> class var(str):
    ...     def __mul__(self, other):
    ...         return self + ' * ' + other
    ...     def __rmul__(self, other):
    ...         return other + ' * ' + self
    >>> prd([var('b'), var('c'), var('d')], var('a'))
    'a * b * c * d'

The ``start`` parameter and the elements found in the iterable can be of different types. It is only required that the output of the multiplication operation can by multiplied with the next element from the iterable::

    >>> prd([], 'a')
    'a'
    >>> prd([1, 2, 3], 'a')
    'aaaaaa'
    >>> prd(['a', 3], 2)
    'aaaaaa'

Development
-----------
All installation and development dependencies are fully specified in ``pyproject.toml``. The ``project.optional-dependencies`` object is used to `specify optional requirements <https://peps.python.org/pep-0621>`__ for various development tasks. This makes it possible to specify additional options (such as ``test``, ``lint``, and so on) when performing installation using `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip>`__::

    python -m pip install .[test,lint]

Testing and Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All unit tests are executed and their coverage is measured when using `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org>`__ (see the ``pyproject.toml`` file for configuration details)::

    python -m pip install .[test]
    python -m pytest

Alternatively, all unit tests are included in the module itself and can be executed using `doctest <https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html>`__::

    python src/prd/prd.py -v

Style conventions are enforced using `Pylint <https://pylint.pycqa.org>`__::

    python -m pip install .[lint]
    python -m pylint src/prd
