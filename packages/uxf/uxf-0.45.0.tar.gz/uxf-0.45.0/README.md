# Python UXF Library

UXF is a plain text human readable optionally typed storage format. UXF may
serve as a convenient alternative to csv, ini, json, sqlite, toml, xml, or
yaml.

For details of the Uniform eXchange Format (UXF) supported by this library,
see the [UXF Overview](../README.md). ([PyPI link to UXF
Overview](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/uxf/blob/main/README.md).)

## Introduction

The Python `uxf` library works out of the box with the standard library and
one dependency,
[editabletuple](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/editabletuple).

- Install: `python3 -m pip install uxf` (or download the wheel `.whl`
  files and do `python -m pip install uxf....whl
  editabletuple...whl` where ... varies)
- Run: `python3 -m uxf -h` _# this shows the command line help_
- Use: `import uxf` _# see the `uxf.py` module docs for the API_

Using `uxf` as an executable (e.g., `python3 -m uxf ...`) provides a means
of doing `.uxf` to `.uxf` conversions (e.g., compress or uncompress or to
use the standard pretty print format). The executable can also be used for
linting and for replacing imports to ensure that UXF files are stand-alone.

Installed alongside `uxf.py` are `uxflint.py`, and `uxfconvert.py` which
might prove useful to see how to use `uxf`. For example, `uxfconvert.py` can
losslessly convert `.uxf` to `.json` or `.xml` and back. It can also do some
simple conversions to and from `.csv`, to `.ini`, and to and from `.sqlite`,
but these are really to illustrate use of the uxf APIs. And also see the UXF
test files in the `../testdata` folder, the Python examples in the `eg`
folder, and the Python tests in the `t` folder.

If you just want to create a small standalone `.pyz`, you could simply copy
`py/uxf.py` as `uxf.py` into your project folder and include it in your
`.pyz` file.

## Python UXF Types

Most Python types convert losslessly to and from UXF types. In particular:

|**Python Type**     |**UXF type**|
|--------------------|------------|
|`None`              | `null`     |
|`bool`              | `bool`     |
|`bytes`             | `bytes`    |
|`bytearray`         | `bytes`    |
|`datetime.date`     | `date`     |
|`datetime.datetime` | `datetime` |
|`int`               | `int`      |
|`float`             | `real`     |
|`str`               | `str`      |
|`uxf.List`          | `list`     |
|`uxf.Map`           | `map`      |
|`uxf.Table`         | `table    `|

A [List](#list-class) is a Python `collections.UserList` subclass with
`.data` (the list)`, .comment` and `.vtype` attributes. A `.vtype` holds a
`str` representing the name of the corresponding UXF type (e.g., `int`,
`real`, etc.) or a `ttype` (the name of a custom table type; see
[TClass](#tclass-class)). If a `.vtype` is `None` it means that _any_ UXF
type may be stored.

Similarly a [Map](#map-class) is a Python `collections.UserDict` subclass
with `.data` (the dict), `.comment`, `.ktype`, and `.vtype` attributes. The
`.ktype` is a `str` like the `.vtype` except that it may only be `None`
(accept any valid _ktype_) or one of `bytes`, `date`, `datetime`, `int`, or
`str`. The `.vtype` works just the same as for [List](#list-class)s.

The [Table](#table-class) class has `.records`, `.comment`, and `.tclass`
attributes; with `.tclass` holding a [TClass](#tclass-class) which in turn
holds the table's `ttype` (i.e., its table type name), and the table's field
names and (optional) types. In all cases a type of `None` signifies that any
type valid for the context may be used.

Custom types can be represented using _ttypes_. For example, for points you
could define a _ttype_ such as: `=point x:real y:real`. Then you could
include single points like `(point 1.5 7.2)`, or many of them such as
`(point 1.5 7.2 8.3 -9.4 14.8 0.6)`.

Collection types such as `set`, `frozenset`, `tuple`, or `collections.deque`
are automatically converted to a [List](#list-class) when they are
encountered. Of course, these are one way conversions.

## API

The simplest part of the API loads and saves (dumps) UXF data from/to
strings or files.

### Reading and Writing UXF Data

    load(filename_or_filelike): -> uxo
    loads(uxt): -> uxo

The [load()](#load-def) function reads UXF data from a file or file-like
object, and the [loads()](#loads-def) function reads UXF data from a string.
The returned `uxo` (UXF object) is of type [Uxf](#uxf-class).

    dump(filename_or_filelike, data)
    dumps(data) -> uxt

The [dump()](#dump-def) function writes the data in UXF format to a file or
file-like object, and the [dumps()](#dumps-def) function writes the data
into a string that's then returned (here called `uxt` to indicate UXF text).
The data can be a [Uxf](#uxfclass) object or a single `list`,
[List](#list-class), `dict`, [Map](#map-class), or [Table](#table-class).

If the data contains values of types that aren't supported by UXF, they
could be transformed in advance (e.g., to a custom table type, a _ttype_).

See also the examples in the `eg` folder and the tests in the `t` folder.

### API Notes

A [UXF](#uxf-class) object (called a `uxo` in these docs) has a `.value`
attribute that is always a [List](#list-class) or [Map](#map-class) or
[Table](#table-class). The first two have essentially the same APIs as
`list` and `dict` respectively. The [Table](#table-class) API is a little
similar to a `list`. Individual records can be accessed using `[]`, but to
work with records or fields the API provides `get_record()`, `set_record()`,
`get_field()`, `set_field()`, amongst others. For small tables, records can
be accessed with the `first`, `second`, `third`, or `fourth` properties. The
best way to append new records is to use the [Table](#table-class)'s
`append()` method.

The `uxf` module distinguishes between a _ttype_ (the name of a user-defined
table) and a [TClass](#tclass-class) (the Python class which represents a
user-defined table). A [TClass](#tclass-class) has `.ttype` and `.fields`
attributes.

For reading UXF data it is easiest to iterate, and to do so recursively, if
the data has nested collections. Note that the `visit.py` example provides a
way of doing this using the visitor design pattern. The `uxfconvert.py`
example shows alternative approaches to manual iteration.

Note that for imports, if the filename is relative it is searched for in the
same folder as the importing UXF file, and if not found there, in the
current folder, and if not there either, in each of the paths in `UXF_PATH`
(if any).

Note that the `__version__` is the module version (i.e., the version of this
implementation), while the `VERSION` is the maximum UXF version that this
module can read (and the UXF version that it writes).

### Classes

The classes are documented in importance order. Here are alphabetically
ordered links:
[Error](#error-class),
[Field](#field-class),
[Format](#format-class),
[List](#list-class),
[Map](#map-class),
[Table](#table-class),
[TClass](#tclass-class),
[Uxf](#uxf-class).

<a name="uxf-class"></a>
#### Uxf

A `Uxf` object represents a UXF file in memory.

The easiest way to obtain a `Uxf` object is to use one of the module-level
functions, [load()](#load-def) or [loads()](#loads-def). Of course, you can
also create ``Uxf``s programatically (as shown in many of the examples and
tests).

##### Constructor

**`Uxf(value=None, *, custom='', tclasses=None, comment=None)`**

The `Uxf` constructor takes an optional `value` (a `list`, `List`, `tuple`,
`dict`, `Map`, or `Table`) and optional (by keyword arguments) `custom`
string, `tclasses` (a `dict` whose names are _ttypes_ and whose values are
the corresponding [TClass](#tclass-class)es), and `comment` string.

To create a `Uxf` programmatically (rather than by using, say,
[load()](#load-def), you can either create it empty, or with some data and
optionally, some _ttypes_.

    value = ... # a list, uxf.List, dict, uxf.Map, or uxf.Table
    point_ttype = uxf.TClass('point', (uxf.Field('x', 'real'), uxf.Field('y', 'real')))
    uxo = uxf.Uxf(value, tclasses={point_ttype.ttype: point_ttype})

##### Properties

**`.value`**

A [List](#list-class), [Map](#map-class), or [Table](#table-class). Since
these classes can nest, a `Uxf` can represent any arbitrary data structure.

**`.custom`**

An opional `str` used for customizing the file format, i.e., the header text
that follows the initial `uxf 1.0` on the first line.

**`.tclasses`**

A possibly empty `dict` where each key is a `ttype` (i.e., the
`.tclass.ttype` which is a [TClass](#tclass-class)'s nameâ€”a `str`) and each
value is a [TClass](#tclass-class) object.

**`.comment`**

An optional file-level `str`.

**`.imports`**

A possibly empty `dict` where each key is a `ttype` and where each value is
a `str` holding that type's import text.

**`.import_filenames`**

A utility useful for some UXF processors. It yields all the unique import
filenames.

##### Methods

<a name="Uxf.load-def"></a>
**`.load(filename_or_filelike, *, on_error=on_error, drop_unused=False, replace_imports=False)`**

Convenience method that wraps the module-level [load()](#load-def) function.

<a name="Uxf.loads-def"></a>
**`.loads(uxt, filename='-', *, on_error=on_error, drop_unused=False, replace_imports=False)`**

Convenience method that wraps the module-level [loads()](#loads-def)
function.

<a name="Uxf.dump-def"></a>
**`.dump(filename_or_filelike, *, on_error=on_error, format=Format())`**

Convenience method that wraps the module-level [dump()](#dump-def) function.

<a name="Uxf.dumps-def"></a>
**`.dumps(*, on_error=on_error, format=Format())`**

Convenience method that wraps the module-level [dumps()](#dumps-def)
function.

<a name="list-class"></a>
#### List

A class used to represent a UXF list. It is a `collections.UserList`
subclass which holds its list in the `.data` attribute and that also has
`.comment` and `.vtype` attributes.

##### Constructor

**`List(seq=None, *, vtype=None, comment=None)`**

The `seq` can be a `list`, `tuple`, or any iterable acceptable to the
built-in `list()` type. The _vtype_ is a `str` signifying the type of value
this list may hold; `None` means values may be of _any_ UXF-compatible type
(see [Python UXF Types](#python-uxf-types)). A `str` may be passed as the
`comment`.

See [Python UXF Types](#python-uxf-types) for more about _vtypes_.

<a name="map-class"></a>
#### Map

A class used to represent a UXF map. It is a `collections.UserDict` subclass
that holds its dict in the `.data` attribute and that also has `.comment`,
`.ktype`, and `.vtype` attributes.

##### Constructor

**`Map(d=None, *, ktype=None, vtype=None, comment=None)`**

The `d` can be a `dict` or any single value acceptable to the built-in
`dict()` type. The _ktype_ is a `str` signifying the type of key that must
be used; `None` means that any valid _ktype_, i.e., `'bytes'`, `'date'`,
`'datetime'`, `'int'`, or `'str'`. The _vtype_ is a `str` signifying the
type of value this `Map` may hold; `None` means values may be of _any_
UXF-compatible type (see [Python UXF Types](#python-uxf-types)). A `str` may
be passed as the `comment`.

See [Python UXF Types](#python-uxf-types) for more about _ktypes_ and
_vtypes_.

<a name="table-class"></a>
#### Table

A class used to store UXF Tables.

##### Constructor

**`Table(tclass=None, *, records=None, comment=None)`**

A `Table` can be created using the constructor, passing a
[TClass](#tclass-class), and optionally, records (a list of lists), and a
comment (a `str`). Alternativvely, use the [table()](#table-def) convenience
function which takes a _ttype_ (a `str`), and fields.

See [Python UXF Types](#python-uxf-types) for more about _ktypes_ and
_ttypes_.

##### Properties

**`.tclass`**

A [TClass](#tclass-class) which holds the table's _ttype_ and field names
(and optional field types).

**`.ttype`**

A convenience for `.tclass.ttype`.

**`.records`**

The table's data: a list of lists of values with each sublist having the
same number of values as the number of `.tclass` fields (i.e.,
`len(table.fields)`)

**`.RecordClass`**

The table's record class, an
[editabletuple](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/editabletuple), which
can be used to create a single record by calling it with each of the
record's values. When a table record is accessed (e.g., when one row of the
table's list is returned), it is returned as an editabletuple of this class.

**`.fields`**

A convenience for `.tclass.fields`.

**`.first`**

The table's first record as a `RecordClass`
[editabletuple](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/editabletuple), or
`None` if the table is empty.

**`.second`**

The table's second record or `None`.

**`.third`**

The table's third record or `None`.

**`.fourth`**

The table's fourth record or `None`.

**`.last`**

The table's last record or `None`.

**`.is_scalar`**

This is `True` if all the table's values are (or ought to be given its
fields' types) scalars; otherwise it is `False`. Its main use is as a helper
for the [dump()](#dump-def) and [dumps()](#dumps-def) functions.

##### Operators

**`table[row]`**

The table's `row`-th record as a `RecordClass`
[editabletuple](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/editabletuple).
(The same as `.get_record(row)`; ses also `.set_record(row, record)`.)

**`iter(table)`**

For example, `for record in table:`. Yields every record in the table as a
`RecordClass` instance.

**`len(table)`**

The number of records (rows) in the table.

##### Methods

**`.append(record)`**

Appends a new row to the table's list of lists as an 
[editabletuple](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/editabletuple) of type
`.RecordClass`. The row can be provided as a `RecordClass` editabletuple or
as a sequence of field values (which will then be converted to the table's
`RecordClass`).

**`.insert(index, record)`**

Inserts the given record (or sequence of field values) into the table at the
given `index` position.

**`.get_record(row)`**

The table's `row`-th record as a `RecordClass`
[editabletuple](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/editabletuple).
(The same as `table[row]`.)

**`.set_record(row, record)`**

Replaces the table's `row`-th record with the given record.

**`.delete_record(row)`**

Deletes the table's `row`-th record.

**`.get_field(row, name_or_index)`**

Returns the table's `row`-th record's ``name_or_index``-th field (if
`name_or_index` is an `int` or the field whose name is ``name_or_index``.

**`.set_field(row, name_or_index, value)`**

Sets the table's `row`-th record's ``name_or_index``-th field (if
`name_or_index` is an `int` or the field whose name is ``name_or_index``, to
the given `value`.

**`.field(column)`**

This function is a convenience for `.tclass.fields[column]`.


<a name="tclass-class"></a>
#### TClass

This class is used to store a [Table](#table-class)'s _ttype_ (i.e., its
name) and fields.

##### Constructor

**`TClass(ttype, fields=None, *, comment=None)`**

The `ttype` must be a `str` that holds the ``TClass``'s name (equivalent to
a _vtype_ or _ktype_ name); it may not be the same as a built-in type name
or constant. Leave `fields` as `None` for a fieldless table; otherwise pass
a sequence of field names (``str``'s) or ``Field``'s (which have field names
and optionally types). The `.comment` may be passed a `str`.


The `.ttype` attribute holds the ``TClass``'s name. The `.fields` attribute
holds a list of fields of type [Field](#field-class). The `.comment` holds
an optional `str`.

The `.isfieldless` property returns `True` if there are no fields (which is
valid for a fieldless table); otherwise returns `False`.

<a name="field-class"></a>
#### Field

This class is used to store a [TClass](#tclass-class)'s fields, i.e., the
fields for a [Table](#table-class).

##### Constructor

**`Field(name, vtype=None)`**

The `name` must start with a letter and be followed by
`0-uxf.MAX_IDENTIFIER_LEN-1` letters, digits, or underscores; it may not be
the same as a built-in type name or constant. A _vtype_ of `None` means that
the field may hold any valid UXF type (see [Python UXF
Types](#python-uxf-types)); otherwise it must be one of these ``str``s:
`bool`, `bytes`, `int`, `real`, `date`, `datetime`, `list`, `map`, `str`, or
`table`; or a _ttype_ name.

<a name="format-class"></a>
#### Format

This class is used to specify aspects of the output format for the
[dump()](#dump-def) and [dumps()](#dumps-def) functions (and the equivalent
methods).

##### Constructor

**`Format(indent='  ', wrap_width=96, realdp=None, max_list_in_line=10,
max_fields_in_line=5, max_short_len=32)`**

The [dump()](#dump-def) and [dumps()](#dumps-def) functions use the default
`Format()` which uses the defaults shown (indent is two spaces). However, by
creating and passing your own `Format` object, you can change these to suit
your needs. For `realdp`, `None` signifies use however many digits after the
decimal point are needed for UXF ``real``'s (i.e., for Python ``float``'s);
otherwise specif a value 0-15.

<a name="error-class"></a>
#### Error

This class is used to propagate errors.

(If this module produces an exception that isn't a `uxf.Error` or `OSError`
subclass then it is probably a bug that should be reported.)

### Functions

The functions are documented in importance order. Here are alphabetically
ordered links:
[append\_to\_parent()](#append_to_parent-def),
[canonicalize()](#canonicalize-def),
[dump()](#dump-def),
[dumps()](#dumps-def),
[isoformat()](#isoformat-def),
[isasciidigit()](#isasciidigit-def),
[is\_scalar()](#is_scalar-def),
[load()](#load-def),
[loads()](#loads-def),
[naturalize()](#naturalize-def),
[on\_error()](#on_error-def),
[table()](#table-def).

<a name="load-def"></a>
**`load(filename_or_filelike, *, on_error=on_error, drop_unused=False,
replace_imports=False)`**

Returns a [Uxf](uxf-class) object.

`filename_or_filelike` is `sys.stdin` or a filename (`str` or
`pathlib.Path`) or an open readable file (text mode UTF-8 encoded,
optionally gzipped).

`on_error` is a custom error handling function that defaults to
[on\_error](#on_error-def).

If `drop_unused` is `True`, then any _ttype_ definitions in the file that
aren't actually used in the data are dropped. So if the `Uxf` is later
dumped, the dropped _ttype_ definitions will not be present.

If `replace_imports` is `True`, then any imports are replaced by the _ttype_
definitions that they import.  So if the `Uxf` is later dumped, _no_ imports
will be present; instead any imported _ttypes_ will be dumped as _ttype_
definitions. Normally, if you use `replace_imports=True`, then you would
also use `drop_unused=True`.

<a name="loads-def"></a>
**`loads(uxt, filename='-', *, on_error=on_error, drop_unused=False,
replace_imports=False)`**

Returns a [Uxf](#uxf-class) object.

`uxt` must be a `str` of UXF data, e.g., `uxf 1.0\n[1 2 3]`.

If given, the `filename` is used for error messages.

For more on the other argument see [load()](#load-def).

<a name="dump-def"></a>
**`dump(filename_or_filelike, data, *, on_error=on_error,
format=Format())`**

`filename_or_filelike` is `sys.stdout` or a filename or an open writable
file (text mode UTF-8 encoded). If `filename_or_filelike` is a filename with
a `.gz` suffix then the output will be gzip-compressed.

`data` is a [Uxf](#uxf-class) object, or a list, [List](#list-class), dict,
[Map](#map-class), or [Table](#table-class), that this function will write
to the `filename_or_filelike` in UXF format.

`format` specifies aspects of the output (e.g., indent); see the
[Format](#format-class) class for details.

<a name="dumps-def"></a>
**`dumps(data, *, on_error=on_error, format=Format())`**

`data` is a [Uxf](#uxf-class) object, or a list, [List](#list-class), dict,
[Map](#map-class), or [Table](#table-class) that this function will write to
a `str` in UXF format which will then be returned.

For more on the other arguments see [dump()](#dump-def).

<a name="table-def"></a>
**`table(ttype, fields, *, comment=None)`**

Convenience function for creating empty tables with a new
[TClass](#tclass-class).

See also the [Table](#table-class).

<a name="naturalize-def"></a>
**`naturalize(s)`**

Given `str` `s` returns `True` if the `str` is 't', 'true', 'y', 'yes', or
`False` if the `str` is 'f', 'false', 'n', 'no' (case-insensitive); or
returns an `int` if `s` holds a parsable int, or a `float` if `s` holds a
parsable `float`, or a `datetime.datetime` if `s` holds a parsable ISO8601
datetime `str`, or a `datetime.date` if `s` holds a parsable ISO8601 date
`str`, or failing these returns the original ``str``, ``s``, unchanged.

This is provided as a helper function (e.g., it is used by `uxfconvert.py`).

<a name="on_error-def"></a>
**`on_error(lino, code, message, *, filename, fail=False, verbose=True)`**

This is the default error handler which you can replace by passing a custom
one to [load()](#load-def), [loads()](#loads-def), [dump()](#dump-def), or
[dumps()](#dumps-def).

This is called with the line number (lino), error code, error message, and
filename. The filename may be '-' or empty if the UXF is created in memory
rather than loaded from a file. If fail is `True` it means the error is
unrecoverable, so the normal action would be to raise. If verbose is `True`
the normal action is to print a textual version of the error data to
`stderr`.

For examples of custom `on_error()` functions, see `t/test_errors.py`,
`t/test_imports.py` `t/test_include.py`, `t/test_merge.py`, and
`t/test_sqlite.py`.

<a name="is_scalar-def"></a>
**`is_scalar(x)`**

Returns `True` if `x` is `None` or a `bool`, `int`, `float`,
`datetime.date`, `datetime.datetime`, `str`, `bytes`, or `bytearray`;
otherwise returns `False`. Its main use is as a helper
for the [dump()](#dump-def) and [dumps()](#dumps-def) functions.


<a name="canonicalize-def"></a>
**`canonicalize(name, is_table_name)`**

Utility for UXF processors. Given a `name`, returns a `name` that is a valid
table or field name. See `uxfconvert.py` for uses.

<a name="append_to_parent-def"></a>
**`append_to_parent(parent, value)`**

Utility for UXF processors; see `uxf.py` and `uxfconvert.py` for examples of
use.

<a name="isasciidigit-def"></a>
**`isasciidigit(s)`**

Returns `True` if `s` matches ``/^[0-9]+$/``. (Python's `str.isdigit()` and
`str.isdecimal()` both match additional digit characters which is why we
use `isasciidigit()`.)

<a name="isoformat-def"></a>
**`isoformat(dt)`**

If `dt` is a `date`, returns the corresponding `str` with format
`'YYYY-MM-DD'`; if `dt` is a `datetime`, returns the corresponding `str`
with format `'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS'`.

### Constants

|**Constant**|**Description**|
|------------|---------------|
|`VERSION`|The UXF file format version|
|`RESERVED_WORDS`|A set of names that cannot be used for table or field names|
|`UTF8`|The string `'utf-8'`|

### Command Line Usage

The uxf module can be used as an executable. To see the command line help
run:

    python3 -m uxf -h

or

    path/to/uxf.py -h
