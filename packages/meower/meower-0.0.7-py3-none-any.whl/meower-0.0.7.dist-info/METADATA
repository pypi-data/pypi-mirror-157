## Installing
`meower.py` is now on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/meower/) (Python Package Index)! That means that you can use `pip3`, or `pip` to install it now!
```
pip3 install meower
```
## Usage
For some reason (maybe because of the lack of a class), you can't use the traditional `import meower` method. Instead, use:
```python
from meower import meower
```
## Building
Before you build, you'd might want to double-check that you have all of the dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the `build` command:
```
python3 -m build
```
## Upgrading
`meower.py` is a ongoing project, so you'd might want to check for updates regularly. You can update the package like this:
```
pip3 install --upgrade meower
```
## Demo Client
```python
from meower import meower

for i in range(0, meower.home_len()):
	print(meower.get_post(meower.find_post(i)))
```
