# faCRSA
A fully automated pipeline for the high-throughput analysis of crop root system architecture. 
## Use faCRSA webserver
‚ù§Ô∏è Try faCRSA at https://root.aiphenomics.com/. You can see help documents about faCRSA usage on the Github page (Section 3. Usage) and at https://root.aiphenomics.com/faq.
## Deploy faCRSA in a private environment
### 1. Installation and launcher
- faCRSA has been tested under Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, CentOS 7, macOS 12 Monterey, and Windows 10 with Python 3.6.0. 
- Install with Conda or manually.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è**Before installing faCRSA, you must install Anaconda.**
#### 1.1 Install with Conda (Recommended)
##### 1.1.1 Install faCRSA from PyPI
```pyt
# Create a clear environment for faCRSA
conda 
create -n facrsa python=3.6.0
conda activate facrsa

# Install faCRSA
pip install faCRSA
```
##### 1.1.2 Launch faCRSA
```pyt
# Launch task queue
facrsa-queue

# Create a new cmd window
# Launch faCRSA web
facrsa-web
```
##### 1.1.3 Open web page
Copy the URL address (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000/) output from the cmd window and open it in the browser.
#### 1.2 Install manually
##### 1.2.1 Clone faCRSA Github  repository
```pyt
# We recommend cloning the faCRSA repository into a clear folder.
cd {your folder}
git clone https://github.com/njauzrn/faCRSA.git
cd faCRSA
```
##### 1.2.2 Install Python requirements
```pyt
# Create a clear environment for faCRSA
conda create -n facrsa python=3.6.0
conda activate facrsa

# Install Python requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##### 1.2.3. Launch faCRSA
```pyt
# Launch task queue
python huey_consumer.py task_queue.huey

# Create a new cmd window
# Launch faCRSA web
flask run
```
##### 1.2.4. Open web page
Copy the URL address (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000/) output from the cmd window and open it in the browser.

### 2. faCRSA initialization
When you visit the web page for the first time, it will automatically jump to the initialization page. You can set  SMTP server information in this page, which used to notify task status. If you don't need this function, please click the following link to skip.

## Usage
### 1 Submit a Task
1. Click "Submit a new task" to load a task. **We recommend you create an account to manage tasks and upload private plugins.**
2. Input task information and upload images.
	- Task Name: set a name to distinguish different tasks.
	- Description: set some information about this task.
	- Pixel-to-cm Conversion Factor (CF): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71422762/176860806-139ebc3d-8daa-4f32-9655-1f831065af2a.png)
	- Segmentation Plugin: select a model to segment root images (default: RootSeg). You can upload a private plugin to segment more types of crops and imaging backgrounds (click here to study how to develop it).
	- E-mail (Optional): receive task notification emails.
	- Upload: 
		- Only several formats (`jpg / png / zip`) are allowed to upload.
		- A single task can only upload the same format.
3. Submit your task and it will automatically redirect to the schedule page.
4. You will be redirected to the result page and receive a task notification email.
### 2 View results
1.  When the task is completed, you will receive a notification email with a link to the result page.
2.  You can viste each results online or download them as a zipfile.
### 3 Upload private plugin
‚ö†Ô∏è**Before uploading, you must create an account.**
1.  Click "Add a plugin" in the "My Plugin" page.
2. Input plugin information and upload files.
### 4 Use private plugin
Select each plugin in the "add task" page.

## Development
### 1. Private plugin
üîó Please click https://root.aiphenomics.com/files/demo_plugin.zip to download the demo code of private plugin.<br>‚ö†Ô∏èEach plugin must be developed based on the following packages.
```pyt
numpy==1.19.2
tensorflow==2.4.0
```
The deep learning model must be constructed by Kears in Tensorflow (code: <code>from tensorflow.keras.layers import *</code>).
#### Development guide
1. Plugin structure:
	- network.py: the deep learning model constructed in the Python programming language.
<<<<<<< HEAD
	
	  > This file must include a function named "main" without any parameters. 
	
	- weight.h5: model weight file (**must be .h5 format**)
	
2. Package these files in zip format.

=======
	- weight.h5: model weight file (**must be .h5 format**)
2. Package these files in zip format.
>>>>>>> 7dd1a061e326ed01d2320179395ecd86d55fab9e
3. Test the availability of each plugin and upload it to faCRSA.
### 2 Training model
RootSeg could be trained for images from other crops and imaging backgrounds.
1. Please click https://root.aiphenomics.com/files/training.zip to download the training script.
2. Unzip the package and open it in PyCharm or VS Code.
3. Generate training data.
4. Switch to the training environment (e.g. facrsa) and start model training.
```pyt
cd {unzip folder}
conda activate facrsa
python training.py
```
