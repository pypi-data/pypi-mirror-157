# MultiBody Celestial Motion Simulation

## Introduction

This is a package built for simulating Multibody Celestial motion and Gravitational Wave of Pulsars or Binary Celestial Bodies.

To install this package just using `pip`:
```sh
pip install PurpleMicroStar
```
And the document is available here at [Home Page of Purple Micro Star](https://airscker.github.io/Purple-Micro-Star/)

## Available Operation
- **MultiGravity Simulation**:
	Simulating motion curve of a cluster of celestial bodies, from single celestial body to as many as possible. Let's see the motion curve of 215 celestial bodies in 10s:

Or Let's see 6 celestial bodies in 1e6s:

- **Single Celestial Simulation**:
	Building single celestial body and give out its properties, including Roche Limit and others
- **Gravitational Wave Simulation**
	Simulating Gravitational Wave signal of binary celestial bodies or pulsars, less to say and look at some beautiful results:

1. Gravitational Wave Field Distribution of Binary Celestial Bodies:
