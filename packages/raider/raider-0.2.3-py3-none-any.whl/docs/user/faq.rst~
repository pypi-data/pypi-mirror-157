Do I need to know Python and Hylang in order to use **Raider**?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, **Raider** documentation already assumes you know the basic
concepts in both Python and Hylang. You don't have to know a lot. If
it's your first time with Python, just get yourself familiar with it,
and when you're ready move on to learning Hylang, which is basically
just Python code surrounded by Lisp parentheses.


Why is Raider using Hylang?
