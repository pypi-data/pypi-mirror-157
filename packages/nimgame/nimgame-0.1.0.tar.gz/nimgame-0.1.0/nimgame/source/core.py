    """Class to implement the Nim game

    Methods:
    - setup_heaps(): initiate the heaps. Note that this creates the heaps
        instance attribute, i.e. there is no need for __init__()
    - set_start(): set which party is to start the game
    - do_move(): do a move, either the Computer's or the Player's turn
    - get_heapstatus(): get the heap status (straws in heaps)
    - game_end(): figure out whether the game ended
    - calculation methods from the mixin

    Attributes:
        heaps (list): it contans the number of straws in each heap. This is
            initiated in setup_heaps().
        activeplayer (str): either the "Computer" or "Player"; or "start" in the
            beginning
        nextturn (iterator.__next__): calling it infinitely yields the swapped
            player names

    Args:
        error_rate: The rate percentage of mistakes the Computer is to make. By
            deafult it is 0%, i.e. the computer never makes mistakes, and the
            Player has no chance to win (unless the Player decides who to start
            and never makes mistakes). If it was set to the extreme 100%, the
            Computer would always intentionally make wrong moves, practically
            making all attempts to lose. NB, if the Player does the same, the
            Computer may still win.
            For testing, when moves of both parties are made by the program,
            the error rate of both parties can be set with the "ErrorRate"
            namedtuple. This can be used to create staistics of games played by
            different skilled players. NB, still, the 1st party will be reported
            in the results as Computer, and the 2nd as Player, just to name
            them.
        heapcount_range: The min and max number of heaps to be set up. Less than
            3 heaps makes little sense, more than 15 is a bit of an overkill.
            So, the default is (3-15), but it can be set otherwise.
        strawcount_range: The min and max number of strwas to be set up in a
            heap. Less than 1 straw makes no sense, more than 20 is a bit of an
            overkill. So, the default is (1-20).
        misere: Whether it is the "misÃ¨re" version of the game.
