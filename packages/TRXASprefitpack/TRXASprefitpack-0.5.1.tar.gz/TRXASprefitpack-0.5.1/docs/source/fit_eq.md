# fit_eq

fit eq: fitting tscan data using the solution of lower triangular 1st order rate equation covolved with gaussian/cauchy(lorenzian)/pseudo voigt irf function.
It uses lmfit python module to fitting experimental time trace data to sequential decay module.
To find contribution of each excited state species, it solves linear least square problem via scipy lstsq module.

```{Note}
In rate equation model, the ground state would be
1. ''first_and_last'' species
2. ''first'' species
3. ''last'' species
4. ground state is not included in the rate equation model
```

```{Note}
1. The number of time zero parameter should be same as the number of scan to fit.
2. The rate equation matrix shoule be lower triangular.
3. if you set shape of irf to pseudo voigt (pv), then you should provide two full width at half maximum value for gaussian and cauchy parts, respectively.

## Format of Rate Equation Matrix 

User supplied rate equation matrix should have following format.

### Example 1. Sequential Decay

```python
A -> B -> C -> D
```

\begin{matrix}
-1*k1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1*k1 & -1*k2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1*k2 & -1*k3 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1*k3 & 0
\end{matrix}

``k1, k2, k3`` mean rate constant of each decay, inverse of lifetime ``tau1, tau2, tau3``.

### Example 2. Branched Decay

```python
A -> B -> D
  -> C -> D
```

\begin{matrix}
-(1*k1+1*k2) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1*k1 & -1*k3 & 0 & 0 \\
1*k2 & 0 & -1*k4 & 0 \\
0 & 1*k3 & 1*k4 & 0
\end{matrix}

Note that the eigenvalues of Branched Decay are $-(k_1+k_2),\ -k_3,\ -k_4,\ 0$. That is the model signal deduced by branched decay is represented by sum of four exponential decay component $\{\exp\left(-(k_1+k_2)t\right), \exp\left(-k_3t\right), \exp\left(-k_4t\right), 1\}$. Therefore time scan fitting does not distinguish branched decay and sequential decay with rate constant $k'_1 = k_1+k_2$, $k'_2 = k_3$, $k'_3 = k_4$ and $k'_4 = 0$. Because of this, in time scan fitting, $k_1$ and $k_2$ in branched decay are highly correlated so that one cannot directly determine ratio between $k_1$ and $k_2$.

However if one knows difference absorption coefficient of each species or ratio of $k_1$ and $k_2$ from other experiments, they want to fix $k_2=r*k_1$ then user can give following rate equation matrix.

For example $r=0.8$,
\begin{matrix}
-(1*k1+0.8*k1) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1*k1 & -1*k2 & 0 & 0 \\
0.8*k1 & 0 & -1*k3 & 0 \\
0 & 1*k2 & 1*k3 & 0
\end{matrix}
