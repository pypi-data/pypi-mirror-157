    Represents a bracket in synchronous Hyperband.

    A bracket consists of a list of rungs. Each rung consists of a number of
    slots and a resource level (called rung level). The larger the rung level,
    the smaller the number of slots.

    A slot is occupied (by a metric value), free, or pending. A pending slot
    has already been returned by `next_free_slot`. Slots
    in the lowest rung (smallest rung level, largest size) are filled first.
    When a rung is fully occupied, slots for the next rung are assigned with
    the trial_id's having the best metric values. At any point in time, only
    slots in the lowest not fully occupied rung can be filled.
