## Install your own copy  :floppy_disk:

Github Actions is generating our data here via cron once a week, on Saturday night.  However, if you prefer, go ahead and use [downloader.py](https://github.com/jthop/ez-emoji/blob/master/ez_emoji/downloader.py) to download your own emoji data whenever you desire.


```shell
python downloader.py [optional_destination_directory]
```
_Unicode seems to release major version updates about once per year.  They also do some minor updates in between._

## Use  :muscle:

Download and use our data, or download the entire package.  We have a few utilities as well which are a work in progress.  One is a python Log Formatter which uses emojis.  That utility also utilizes another which simply picks random emojis based on the sentiment desired.
