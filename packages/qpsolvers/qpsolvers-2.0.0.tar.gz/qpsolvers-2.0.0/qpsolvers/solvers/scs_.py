    Solve a Quadratic Program defined as:

            \\frac{1}{2} x^T P x + q^T x \\\\

            & A x = b
        \\end{array}\\end{split}

    using `SCS <https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P :
        Primal quadratic cost matrix.
    q :
        Primal quadratic cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality constraint matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality constraint vector.
    A :
        Linear equality constraint matrix.
    b :
        Linear equality constraint vector.
    initvals :
        Warm-start guess vector (not used).
    eps_abs : float
        Absolute feasibility tolerance, see `Termination criteria
        <https://www.cvxgrp.org/scs/algorithm/index.html#termination>`_.
    eps_rel : float
        Relative feasibility tolerance, see `Termination criteria
        <https://www.cvxgrp.org/scs/algorithm/index.html#termination>`_.
    verbose :
        Set to `True` to print out extra information.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Solution to the QP, if found, otherwise ``None``.

    Notes
    -----
    Keyword arguments are forwarded as is to SCS. For instance, you can call
    ``scs_solve_qp(P, q, G, h, normalize=True)``. Solver settings for SCS are
    described `here <https://www.cvxgrp.org/scs/api/settings.html#settings>`_.

    As of SCS 3.0.1, the default feasibility tolerances are set ``1e-4``,
    resulting in larger inequality constraint violations than with other
    solvers on the README and unit test problems. We lower them to ``1e-9`` so
    that SCS behaves closer to the other solvers. If you don't need that much
    precision, increase them for better performance.
