Changelog
=========


(unreleased)
------------
- Small formatiing change. [Andreas Wicenec]
- Release memory as soon as possible. [Rodrigo Tobar]

  The PickOne application kept a reference to the inputs' contents,
  preventing some memory from being released back to the system, even when
  the DLM was in action.

  This commit prevents memory from being referenced, which in turn reduces
  the pressure on the system.
- Added note about restart. [awicenec]
