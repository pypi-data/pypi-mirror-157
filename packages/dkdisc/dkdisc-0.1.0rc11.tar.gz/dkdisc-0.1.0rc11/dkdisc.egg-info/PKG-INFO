## Dean-Kawasaki Discretizations

This repository contains code that solves the Dean-Kawasaki equations in arbitrary number of 
dimensions using arbitrary many particles and produces arbitrary many sample paths. The 
brunt of the code is vectorized using numpy to allow for quickly computing these samples
on a large scale.
