Goes through these pages and prints all of the categories and items

.. testcode::

    from tidalapi.page import PageItem, PageLink
    from tidalapi.mix import Mix

    home = session.home()
    home.categories.extend(session.explore().categories)
    home.categories.extend(session.videos().categories)

    for category in home.categories:
        print(category.title)

    for category in home.categories:
        print(category.title)
        for item in category.items:
            if isinstance(item, PageItem):
                print("\t" + item.short_header)
                print("\t" + item.short_sub_header[0:50])
                # Call item.get() on this one, for example on click
            elif isinstance(item, PageLink):
                print("\t" + item.title)
                # Call item.get() on this one, for example on click
            elif isinstance(item, Mix):
                print("\t" + item.title)
                # You can optionally call item.get() to request the items() first, but it does it for you if you don't
            else:
                print("\t" + item.name)
                # An album could be handled by session.album(item.id) for example,
                # to get full details. Usually the relevant info is there already however
            print()

.. testoutput::
    :hide:
    :options: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
