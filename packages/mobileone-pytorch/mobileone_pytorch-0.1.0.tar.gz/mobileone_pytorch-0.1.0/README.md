### About MobileOne

MobileOne is a novel architecture that achieving an inference time
under 1 ms on an iPhone12 with 75.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.

- We show that MobileOne achieves state-of-the-art performance
within the efficient architectures while being many times faster
on mobile.

- Our best model obtains similar performance on ImageNet
as [Mobile-Former](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05895) while being 38Ã— faster.
Our model obtains 2.3% better top-1 accuracy on ImageNet
than [EfficientNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) at similar latency.

### Installation

Install from source:

```bash
git clone http://gitea.intranet.argo.vision:3000/fpozzi/mobileone.git
cd mobileone
pip install -e .
```

### Usage

#### Create models

Create MobileOne models:

```python
from mobileone_pytorch import (
   mobileone_s0, 
   mobileone_s1, 
   mobileone_s2, 
   mobileone_s3, 
   mobileone_s4
)

model_s0 = mobileone_s0()
model_s1 = mobileone_s1()
model_s2 = mobileone_s2()
model_s3 = mobileone_s3()
model_s4 = mobileone_s4()
```

#### Deployment via reparametrization

Deploy a MobileOne:

```python
import torch
from mobileone_pytorch import mobileone_s1

x = torch.rand(1, 3, 224, 224)

model = mobileone_s1()
deployed = model.reparametrize()

model.eval()
deployed.eval()

out1 = model(x)
out2 = deployed(x)

torch.testing.assert_close(out1, out2)
```
