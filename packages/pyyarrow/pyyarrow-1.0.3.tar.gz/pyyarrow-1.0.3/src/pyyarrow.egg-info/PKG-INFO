Description: # Yarrow: a data format for computer vision
        
        ---------------
        
        ## What is it ?
        
        **yarrow** is a python package to parse, manipulate and serialize data
        following the yarrow [data schema](/schema/yarrow_schema.json). This format is
        oriented around computer vision data and is heavily inspired by the COCO
        [dataset format](https://cocodataset.org/#format-data) and was initially developed
        and used in Michelin projects.
        
        ## How to install
        
        ```sh
        pip install yarrow
        ```
        
        ## How to use
        
        You can find multiple examples in the [examples directory](/examples/) and soon in a proper documentation (WIP). Here are a few examples.
        
        ```python
        import json
        
        from yarrow import YarrowDataset
        
        # say you have a yarrow file at path
        file_path = "path/to/file.yarrow.json"
        
        yar_set = YarrowDataset.parse_file(file_path)
        # You now have a YarrowDataset !
        
        # Add annotations
        annot = Annotation(...) # see documentation for parameters
        yar_set.add_annotation(annot)
        
        # now save it somewhere else
        with open("path/to/other/file.yarrow.json", "w") as fp:
            json.dump(yar_set.pydantic().dict(), fp, default=str)
        
        ```
