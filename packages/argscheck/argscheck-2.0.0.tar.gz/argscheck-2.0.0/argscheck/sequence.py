"""
Sequences
=========

This page documents checkers for sequence objects.

We define a sequence as a class that:

1. Implements `__len__()`.
2. Implements `__getitem__()`, which accepts (among others) integers starting from zero and up to (and not including) the object's own length.
3. Can be instantiated from an iterable.

We define a mutable sequence as a class that:

1. Is a sequence.
2. Implements `__setitem__()`, which accepts the same keys as `__getitem__()`.

Sequences (mutable or otherwise)  can be homogeneous, i.e. all items in it satisfy the same set of conditions.

Homogeneity can be checked for using by providing one or more positional arguments to the checker's constructor.

Checkers that convert values (like :class:`.Optional` for example) are applied as follows:

1. For mutable sequences, converted items are set inplace.
2. For (non-mutable) sequences, a new sequence instance is created from the converted items (this will happen only if
   actual conversion took place for at least one item).
