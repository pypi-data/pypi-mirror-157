By default, your library will be exported to a `library/` directory in your current working directory.
You can change it with the `-o path/to/directory` parameter. 

## Support

Firefox and Chrome are supported (use `-b firefox` or `-b chrome`, defaults to firefox). Headless mode can also be deactivated with the `-H` flag (Headless mode seems to break on Chrome).
