PYTORCH EXPLAIN DOCUMENTATION
===============================

`PyTorch, Explain!` is an extension library for PyTorch to develop
explainable deep learning models called Logic Explained Networks (LENs).

It consists of various methods for explainability from a variety of published papers, including the APIs
required to get first-order logic explanations from deep neural networks.

Quick start
-----------

You can install ``torch_explain`` along with all its dependencies from
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/torch_explain/>`__:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt torch-explain


Source
------

The source code and minimal working examples can be found on
`GitHub <https://github.com/pietrobarbiero/pytorch_explain>`__.
