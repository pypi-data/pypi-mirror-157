## [0.4.3.1]
### Bugfix

- Added an optional parameter `subset` to the classmethod `from_provider` in the class `MemoryLabelProvider`. 

## [0.4.2.0]
### Added
- Added a rename_labels method to generate a new LabelProvider with renamed labels
- Added better `__repr__` and `__str__` methods for Environments, LabelProviders and Instance(Provider)s
- LabelProviders have a dictionary like interface (readonly for now)

```python
env.labels[20]
# frozenset("Games")

new_label_provider = il.MemoryLabelProvider.rename_labels(env.labels, {"Bedrijfsnieuws": "New label"})
```


## [0.4.1.0]
### Added
-  Added support for combining different Pandas DataFrames into a single Environment.

## [0.4.0.0]
### Added
- Storing providers in the Environment. The Environments provides a dictionary like 
interface for provider
```python
env["train"], env["test"] = env.train_test_split(env.dataset, 0.70)
```

## [0.3.9.1]
### Bugfix
- Bugfix for on the fly encoding of data

## [0.3.9.0]
### Added
- Added create_subset_by_labels method that allows you to take a create a InstanceProvider based on labels
- Added a version of the SklearnDataClassifier that allows for on the fly encoding of data

## [0.3.8.0]
### Added
- Added preliminary support reading datasets in TREC qrel format
- Added several utility functions for handling probability matrices that only contain a single column

## [0.3.7.0]
### Added
- Confusion matrices for binary and multiclass performance analysis
- Added to_dict() method for instances.

## [0.3.6.2]
### Changed
- Bugfix in sklearn_model prediction function for when an empty list is provided as input.

## [0.3.6.1]
### Changed
- Bugfix in build_model class method for Sklearn models

## [0.3.6.0]
### Changed
- We now support models that output the full label in string format instead of categorical integer encoding.
- You can now convert the integer encoded labels from a sklearn model to string values, if that is necessary to match with your environment.

## [0.3.5.1]
### Changed
- Fixed a bug in which fitting a classifier failed if some instances did not have labels (Binary/Multiclass classifcation only).

## [0.3.5.0]
### Added
- Documentation for machinelearning subpackage
- More functionality available from top level import


## [0.3.4.4]
### Changed
- Bugfix: vectorize module was imported instead of vectorize function

## [0.3.4.3]
### Added
- Make Feature Extraction / Vectorization accessible from toplevel import

## [0.3.4.2]
### Changed
- Changed return type Environment to AbstractEnvironment in the pandas_to_env_with_id function
## [0.3.4.1] - 2021-10-27

### Added
