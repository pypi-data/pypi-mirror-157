## Stripe Payments

First, configure the `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
settings, with the API keys from the Stripe dashboard.

To receive payment confirmation from Stripe, we need to receive a
webhook from them.

For local development, you can receive this with the [stripe
CLI](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli):

```
$ stripe login
...
$ stripe listen --forward-to http://127.0.0.1:8000/invoices/stripe-webhook/
> Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_I_AM_A_SECRET_KEY (^C to quit)
```

Configure `STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET` with the secret key provided by
`stripe-cli listen`.

For production use, configure a webhook in the Stripe dashboard.
The endpoint should be `https://my.debconf/invoices/stripe-webhook/`.
Listen for `charge.dispute.created`,  `charge.refunded`, and
`payment_intent.succeeded`.
Again, `STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET` should be configured to the webhook's
signing secret.
