"POPPY (**P**\ hysical **O**\ ptics **P**\ ropagation in **Py**\ thon) is a Python package that simulates physical optical propagation including diffraction. It implements a flexible framework for modeling Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction and point spread function formation, particularly in the context of astronomical telescopes."
