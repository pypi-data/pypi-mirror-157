## Functionality of Keygener

- Generate unique Keys
- Generate unique Passwords
- Pick Random Number from a list of numbers

## Usage

- Make sure you have Python installed in your system.
- Run Following command in the CMD.
 ```
  pip install Keygener==version
  ```
# Keygener has 3 functions that you can use 
- genKey(length of the key you need to generate) 
- genPass(length of the Password you need to generate)
- pickRan(list('12345678'),How much values you need to pick)
## Example
 
# genKey()
 ```
import keygener

print(keygener.genKey(10))
 ```
- Out put
- XV6gmjB5CV

# genPass()
 ```
import keygener

print(keygener.genPass(20))
 ```
- Out put
- ±j/U?f,I4hv%L{V7§^ez

# pickRan()
 ```
import keygener

print(keygener.pickRan(list('1234567890',2))
 ```
- Out put
- 26

# incrypt()
 ```
import keygener

password = keygener.genPass(20)
print(keygener.incrypt(password))
 ```
- Out put
- zz$%c£$*^&45ta><fhdnmk8&ncm_fhdnc£$*c£$*

# desIncrypt()
 ```
import keygener

password = keygenertest.genPass(10)
print('Password : ', password)
incrypt = keygenertest.incrypt(password)
print('Incrypted : ', incrypt)
print('Desincrypted : ', keygenertest.desIncrypt(incrypt))
 ```
- Out put
- Password :  sq2zneac-(
- Incrypted :  cn§∞dnc¡mk8&¢~)~o*&#sy^&shg¢ki*(lk&*bv^&
- Desincrypted :  sq2zneac-(

## !!Warning!!
- incrypt() and desIncrypt() function works bestly with the passwords generated by keygener
- if you use other passwords thats not generated by keygener incrypt() may show an unknown value error and if you want you can change the values to the values that are supported by keygener
- we are working hard to increase the amount of supported characters in keygener incrypt() and disIncrypt() functions.
