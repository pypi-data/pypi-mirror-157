FUNPACK is a command-line program which you can use to extract data from UK
BioBank (and other tabular) data. You can run FUNPACK by calling the
`fmrib_unpack` command.


You can give FUNPACK one or more input files (e.g. `.csv`, `.tsv`), and it
will merge them together, perform some preprocessing, and produce a single
output file.


A large number of rules are built into FUNPACK which are specific to the UK
BioBank data set. But you can control and customise everything that FUNPACK
does to your data, including which rows and columns to extract, and which
cleaning/processing steps to perform on each column.


**Important** The examples in this notebook assume that you have installed
FUNPACK 3.3.1 or newer.


> **Note:** The `fmrib_unpack` command was called `funpack` in older versions
> of FUNPACK, but was changed to `fmrib_unpack` in 3.0.0 to avoid a naming
> conflict with an [unrelated software
> package](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/).


```
fmrib_unpack -V
```

## Overview


FUNPACK performs the following steps:


### 1. Import


All data files are loaded in, unwanted columns and subjects are dropped, and
the data files are merged into a single table (a.k.a. data frame). Multiple
files can be merged according to an index column (e.g. subject ID). Or, if the
input files contain the same columns/subjects, they can be naively
concatenated along rows or columns.


> _Note:_ FUNPACK refers to UK Biobank **Data fields** as **variables**. The
> two terms can be considered equivalent.


### 2. Cleaning


The following cleaning steps are applied to each column:

1. **NA value replacement:** Specific values for some columns are replaced
   with NA, for example, variables where a value of `-1` indicates *Do not
   know*.


2. **Variable-specific cleaning functions:** Certain columns are
   re-formatted; for example, the [ICD10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10)
   disease codes can be converted to integer representations.


3. **Categorical recoding:** Certain categorical columns are re-coded.


4. **Child value replacement:** NA values within some columns which are
   dependent upon other columns may have values inserted based on the values
   of their parent columns.


### 3. Processing


During the processing stage, columns may be removed, merged, or expanded into
additional columns. For example, a categorical column may be expanded into a set
of binary columns, one for each category.


A column may also be removed on the basis of being too sparse, or being
redundant with respect to another column.


### 4. Export


The processed data can be saved as a `.csv`, `.tsv`, or `.hdf5` file.


## Examples


Throughout these examples, we are going to use a few command line
options, which you will probably **not** normally want to use:

 - We will alias `fmrib_unpack` to `funpack`, to save a little typing.

 - `-ow` (short for `--overwrite`): This tells `fmrib_unpack` not to complain
   if the output file already exists.

 - `-q` (short for `--quiet`): This tells `fmrib_unpack` to be quiet.  Without
   the `-q` option, `fmrib_unpack` can be quite verbose, which can be
   annoying, but is very useful when things go wrong. A good strategy is to
   tell `fmrib_unpack` to produce verbose output using the `--noisy` (`-n` for
   short) option, and to send all of its output to a log file with the
   `--log_file` (or `-lf`) option.  For example:

   > ```
   > fmrib_unpack -n -n -n -lf log.txt out.tsv in.tsv
   > ```


```
alias funpack="fmrib_unpack -ow -q"
```


Here's the first example input data set, with UK BioBank-style column names:


```
cat data_01.tsv
```


The numbers in each column name typically represent:


1. The variable ID
2. The visit, for variables which were collected at multiple points in time.
3. The "instance", for multi-valued variables.


Note that one **variable** is typically associated with several **columns**,
although we're keeping things simple for this first example - there is only
one visit for each variable, and there are no multi-valued variables.


> _Most but not all_ variables in the UK BioBank contain data collected at
> different visits, the times that the participants visited a UK BioBank
> assessment centre. However there are some variables (e.g.  [ICD10 diagnosis
> codes](https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=41202)) for which
> this is not the case.


## Import examples


### Selecting variables (columns)


You can specify which variables you want to load in the following ways, using
the `--variable` (`-v` for short), `--category` (`-c` for short) and
`--column` (`-co` for short) command line options:


 * By variable ID
 * By variable ranges
 * By a text file which contains the IDs you want to keep.
 * By pre-defined variable categories
 * By column name


#### Selecting individual variables


Simply provide the IDs of the variables you want to extract:


```
funpack -v 1 -v 5 out.tsv data_01.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


#### Selecting variable ranges


The `--variable`/`-v` option accepts MATLAB-style ranges of the form
`start:step:stop` (where the `stop` is inclusive):


```
funpack -v 1:3:10 out.tsv data_01.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


#### Selecting variables with a file


If your variables of interest are listed in a plain-text file, you can simply
pass that file:


```
echo -e "1\n6\n9" > vars.txt
funpack -v vars.txt out.tsv data_01.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


#### Selecting variables from pre-defined categories


Some UK BioBank-specific categories are
[built into FUNPACK](#Built-in-rules), but you can also define your own
categories - you just need to create a `.tsv` file, and pass it to
FUNPACK via the `--category_file` (`-cf` for short):


```
echo -e "ID\tCategory\tVariables"      > custom_categories.tsv
echo -e "1\tCool variables\t1:5,7"    >> custom_categories.tsv
echo -e "2\tUncool variables\t6,8:10" >> custom_categories.tsv
cat custom_categories.tsv
```


Use the `--category` (`-c` for short) to select categories to output. You can
refer to categories by their ID:


```
funpack -cf custom_categories.tsv -c 1 out.tsv data_01.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


Or by name:


```
funpack -cf custom_categories.tsv -c uncool out.tsv data_01.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


#### Selecting column names


If you are working with data that has non-UK BioBank style column names, you
can use the `--column` (`-co` for short) to select individual columns by their
name, rather than the variable with which they are associated. The `--column`
option accepts full column names, and also shell-style wildcard patterns:


```
funpack -co 4-0.0 -co "??-0.0" out.tsv data_01.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


### Selecting subjects (rows)


FUNPACK assumes that the first column in every input file is a subject
ID. You can specify which subjects you want to load via the `--subject` (`-s`
for short) option. You can specify subjects in the same way that you specified
variables above, and also:

 * By specifying a conditional expression on variable values - only subjects
   for which the expression evaluates to true will be imported
 * By specifying subjects to exclude



#### Selecting individual subjects


```
funpack -s 1 -s 3 -s 5 out.tsv data_01.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


#### Selecting subject ranges


```
funpack -s 2:2:10 out.tsv data_01.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


#### Selecting subjects from a file


```
echo -e "5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10" > subjects.txt
funpack -s subjects.txt out.tsv data_01.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


#### Selecting subjects by variable value


The `--subject` option accepts *variable expressions* - you can write an
expression performing numerical comparisons on variables (denoted with a
leading `v`) and combine these expressions using boolean algebra. Only
subjects for which the expression evaluates to true will be imported. For
example, to only import subjects where variable 1 is greater than 10, and
variable 2 is less than 70, you can type:


```
funpack -s "v1 > 10 && v2 < 70" out.tsv data_01.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


The following symbols can be used in variable expressions:


| Symbol                    | Meaning                         |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| <code>==</code>           | equal to                        |
| <code>!=</code>           | not equal to                    |
| <code>&gt;</code>         | greater than                    |
| <code>&gt;=</code>        | greater than or equal to        |
| <code>&lt;</code>         | less than                       |
| <code>&lt;=</code>        | less than or equal to           |
| <code>na</code>           | N/A                             |
| <code>&amp;&amp;</code>   | logical and                     |
| <code>&#x7c;&#x7c;</code> | logical or                      |
| <code>~</code>            | logical not                     |
| <code>contains</code>     | Contains sub-string             |
| <code>all</code>          | all columns must meet condition |
| <code>any</code>          | any column must meet condition  |
| <code>()</code>           | to denote precedence            |


> The `all` and `any` symbols allow you to control how an expression is

> (e.g. separate columns for each visit). We will give an example of this in
> the section on [selecting visits](#Selecting-visits), below.


Non-numeric (i.e.  string) variables can be used in these expressions in
conjunction with the `==`, `!=`, and `contains` operators, and date/time
variables can be compared using the `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=`
operators. For example, imagine that we have the following data set:


```
cat data_02.tsv
```


And we want to identify subjects who were born during or after 1965 (variable
33), and who have a value of `B` for variable 1:


```
funpack -s "v33 >= 1965-01-01 && v1 == 'B'" out.tsv data_02.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


> When comparing dates and times, you must use the format `YYYY-MM-DD` and
> `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. When comparing strings, you must surround values
> with single or double quotes.


Evaluating a variable expression requires the data for every subject to be
loaded into memory, so that the conditional expression can be evaluated.


A useful strategy, if you intend to work with the same subset of subjects more
than once, is to use FUNPACK once, to identify the subjects of interest, save
their IDs to a text file (e.g. `subjects.txt`), and on subsequent calls to
FUNPACK, use the text file to select subjects (e.g. `fmrib_unpack -s
subjects.txt`).  This means that subsequent FUNPACK runs will be faster, and
will require less memory.


The `--ids_only` option can be used to generate an output file which only
contains the IDs of the rows which would have been output, so can be used to
generate a subject ID file. Let's re-run one of the examples above, but this
time with the `--ids_only` option:


```
funpack --ids_only -v 1,2 -s "v1 > 10 && v2 < 70" subjects.txt data_01.tsv
cat subjects.txt
```

Now we can use `subjects.txt` with the `-s` option in subsequent FUNPACK
calls, to select the same subjects without having to re-evaluate the variable
expression.


#### Excluding subjects


The `--exclude` (`-ex` for short) option allows you to exclude subjects - it
accepts individual IDs, an ID range, or a file containing IDs. The
`--exclude`/`-ex` option takes precedence over the `--subject`/`-s` option:


```
funpack -s 1:8 -ex 5:10 out.tsv data_01.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


### Selecting visits


Many variables in the UK BioBank data contain observations at multiple points in
time, or visits. FUNPACK allows you to specify which visits you are interested
in. Here is an example data set with variables that have data for multiple
visits (remember that the second number in the column names denotes the visit):


```
cat data_03.tsv
```

We can use the `--visit` (`-vi` for short) option to get just the last visit for
each variable:


```
funpack -vi last out.tsv data_03.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


You can also specify which visit you want by its number:


```
funpack -vi 1 out.tsv data_03.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


> Variables which are not associated with specific visits (e.g. [ICD10
> diagnosis codes](https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=41202))
> will not be affected by the `-vi` option.


#### Evaluating expressions across visits


The variable expressions described above in the section on [selecting
subjects](#Selecting-subjects-by-variable-value) will be applied to all of
the columns associated with a variable. By default, an expression will
evaluate to true where the values in _any_ column asssociated with the
variable evaluate to true. For example, we can extract the data for subjects
where the values of any column of variable 2 were less than 50:


```
funpack -v 2 -s 'v2 < 50' out.tsv data_03.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


We can use the `any` and `all` operators to control how an expression is
evaluated across the columns of a variable. For example, we may only be
interested in subjects for whom all columns of variable 2 were greater than
50:


```
funpack -v 2 -s 'all(v2 < 50)' out.tsv data_03.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


We can use `any` and `all` in expressions involving multiple variables:


```
funpack -v 2,3 -s 'any(v2 < 50) && all(v3 >= 40)' out.tsv data_03.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


### Merging multiple input files


If your data is split across multiple files, you can specify how FUNPACK
should merge them together.


#### Merging by subject


For example, let's say we have these two input files (shown side-by-side):


```
echo " " | paste data_04.tsv - data_05.tsv
```


Note that each file contains different variables, and different, but
overlapping, subjects. By default, when you pass these files to FUNPACK, it
will output the intersection of the two files (more formally known as an
*inner join*), i.e. subjects which are present in both files:


```
funpack out.tsv data_04.tsv data_05.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


If you want to keep all subjects, you can instruct FUNPACK to output the union
(a.k.a. *outer join*) via the `--merge_strategy` (`-ms` for short) option:


```
funpack -ms outer out.tsv data_04.tsv data_05.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


#### Merging by column


Your data may be organised in a different way. For example, these next two
files contain different groups of subjects, but overlapping columns:


```
echo " " | paste data_06.tsv - data_07.tsv
```


In this case, we need to tell FUNPACK to merge along the row axis, rather than
along the column axis. We can do this with the `--merge_axis` (`-ma` for short)
option:


```
funpack -ma rows out.tsv data_06.tsv data_07.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


Again, if we want to retain all columns, we can tell FUNPACK to perform an
outer join with the `-ms` option:


```
funpack -ma rows -ms outer out.tsv data_06.tsv data_07.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


#### Naive merging


Finally, your data may be organised such that you simply want to "paste", or
concatenate them together, along either rows or columns. For example, your
data files might look like this:


```
echo " " | paste data_08.tsv - data_09.tsv
```


Here, we have columns for different variables on the same set of subjects, and
we just need to concatenate them together horizontally. We do this by using
`--merge_strategy naive` (`-ms naive` for short):


```
funpack -ms naive out.tsv data_08.tsv data_09.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


For files which need to be concatenated vertically, such as these:


```
echo " " | paste data_10.tsv - data_11.tsv
```


We need to tell FUNPACK which axis to concatenate along, again using the `-ma`
option:


```
funpack -ms naive -ma rows out.tsv data_10.tsv data_11.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


## Cleaning examples


Once the data has been imported, a sequence of cleaning steps are applied to
each column.


### NA insertion


For some variables it may make sense to discard or ignore certain values. For
example, if an individual selects *Do not know* to a question such as *How
much milk did you drink yesterday?*, that answer will be coded with a specific
value (e.g. `-1`). It does not make any sense to include these values in most
analyses, so FUNPACK can be used to mark such values as *Not Available
(NA)*.


A large number of NA insertion rules, specific to UK BioBank variables, are
coded into FUNPACK, and are applied when you use the `-cfg fmrib` option
(see the section below on [built-in rules](#Built-in-rules)). You can also
specify your own rules via the `--na_values` (`-nv` for short) option.


Let's say we have this data set:


```
cat data_12.tsv
```


For variable 1, we want to ignore values of -1, for variable 2 we want to
ignore -1 and 0, and for variable 3 we want to ignore 1 and 2:


```
funpack -nv 1 " -1" -nv 2 " -1,0" -nv 3 "1,2" out.tsv data_12.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


The `--na_values` option expects two arguments:

 * The variable ID
 * A comma-separated list of values to replace with NA


### Variable-specific cleaning functions


A small number of cleaning/preprocessing functions are built into FUNPACK,
which can be applied to specific variables. For example, some variables in the
UK BioBank contain ICD10 disease codes, which may be more useful if converted
to a numeric format (e.g. to make them easy to load into MATLAB).  Imagine
that we have some data with ICD10 codes:


```
cat data_13.tsv
```


We can use the `--clean` (`-cl` for short) option with the built-in
`codeToNumeric` cleaning function to convert the codes to a numeric
representation<sup>&amp;</sup>:


```
funpack -cl 1 "codeToNumeric('icd10')" out.tsv data_13.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


> <sup>&amp;</sup>The `codeToNumeric` function will replace each ICD10 code
> with the corresponding *Node* number, as defined in the UK [BioBank ICD10
> data coding](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/coding.cgi?id=19).


The `--clean` option expects two arguments:

 * The variable ID
 * The cleaning function to apply. Some cleaning functions accept
   arguments - refer to the command-line help for a summary of available
   functions.


You can find a list of the built-in cleaning functions
[here](function_reference.html). You can also define your own cleaning
functions by passing them in as a `--plugin_file` (see the [section on custom
plugins below](#Custom-cleaning,-processing-and-loading---funpack-plugins)).


#### Example: flattening hierarchical data


Several variables in the UK Biobank (including the ICD10 disease
categorisations) are organised in a hierarchical manner - each value is a
child of a more general parent category.  The `flattenHierarchical` cleaninng
function can be used to replace each value in a data set with the value that
corresponds to a parent category. Let's apply this to our example ICD10 data
set.


```
funpack -cl 1 "flattenHierarchical(name='icd10')" out.tsv data_13.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


#### Aside: ICD10 mapping file


FUNPACK has a feature specific to these ICD10 disease categorisations - you
can use the `--icd10_map_file` (`-imf` for short) option to tell FUNPACK to
save a file which contains a list of all ICD10 codes that were present in the
input data, and the corresponding numerical codes that FUNPACK generated:


```
funpack -cl 1 "codeToNumeric('icd10')" -imf icd10_codes.tsv out.tsv data_13.tsv
cat icd10_codes.tsv
```


### Categorical recoding


You may have some categorical data which is coded in an awkward manner, such as
in this example, which encodes the amount of some item that an individual has
consumed:


![data coding example](coding.png)


You can use the `--recoding` (`-re` for short) option to recode data like this
into something more useful. For example, given this data:


```
cat data_14.tsv
```


Let's recode it to be more monotonic:


```
funpack -re 1 "300,444,555" "3,0.25,0.5" out.tsv data_14.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


The `--recoding` option expects three arguments:

 * The variable ID
 * A comma-separated list of the values to be replaced
 * A comma-separated list of the values to replace them with


### Child value replacement


Imagine that we have these two questions:


 * **1**: *Do you currently smoke cigarettes?*
 * **2**: *How many cigarettes did you smoke yesterday?*


Now, question 2 was only asked if the answer to question 1 was *Yes*. So for
all individuals who answered *No* to question 1, we will have a missing value
for question 2. But for some analyses, it would make more sense to have a
value of 0, rather than NA, for these subjects.


FUNPACK can handle these sorts of dependencies by way of *child value
replacement*. For question 2, we can define a conditional variable expression
such that when both question 2 is NA and question 1 is *No*, we can insert a
value of 0 into question 2.


This scenario is demonstrated in this example data set (where, for
question 1 values of `1` and `0` represent *Yes* and *No* respectively):


```
cat data_15.tsv
```


We can fill in the values for variable 2 by using the `--child_values` (`-cv`
for short) option:


```
funpack -cv 2 "v1 == 0" "0" out.tsv data_15.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


The `--child_values` option expects three arguments:

 * The variable ID
 * An expression evaluating some condition on the parent variable(s)
 * A value to replace NA with where the expression evaluates to true.


## Processing examples


After every column has been cleaned, the entire data set undergoes a series of
processing steps. The processing stage may result in columns being removed or
manipulated, or new columns being added.


The processing stage can be controlled with these options:

 * `--prepend_process` (`-ppr` for short): Apply a processing function before
   the built-in processing
 * `--append_process` (`-apr` for short): Apply a processing function after the
   built-in processing


A default set of processing steps are applied when you apply the `fmrib`
configuration profile by using `-cfg fmrib` - see the section on [built-in
rules](#Built-in-rules).


The `--prepend_process` and `--append_process` options require two arguments:

 * The variable ID(s) to apply the function to, or `all` to denote all
   variables.
 * The processing function to apply. The available processing functions are
   listed [here](function_reference.html) and in the [command line
   help](command_line.html), or you can write your own and pass it in as a
   plugin file ([see
   below](#Custom-cleaning,-processing-and-loading---funpack-plugins)).


### Sparsity check


The `removeIfSparse` process will remove columns that are deemed to have too
many missing values. If we take this data set:


```
cat data_16.tsv
```


Imagine that our analysis requires at least 8 values per variable to work. We
can use the `minpres` option to `removeIfSparse` to drop any columns which do
not meet this threshold:


```
funpack -apr all "removeIfSparse(minpres=8)" out.tsv data_16.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


You can also specify `minpres` as a proportion, rather than an absolute number.
e.g.:


```
funpack -apr all "removeIfSparse(minpres=0.65, abspres=False)" out.tsv data_16.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


### Redundancy check


You may wish to remove columns which contain redundant information. The
`removeIfRedundant` process calculates the pairwise correlation between all
columns, and removes columns with a correlation above a threshold that you
provide. Imagine that we have this data set:


```
cat data_17.tsv
```


The data in column `2-0.0` is effectively equivalent to the data in column
`1-0.0`, so is not of any use to us. We can tell FUNPACK to remove it like
so:


```
funpack -apr all "removeIfRedundant(0.9)" out.tsv data_17.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


The `removeIfRedundant` process can also calculate the correlation of the
patterns of missing values between variables - Consider this example:


```
cat data_18.tsv
```


All three columns are highly correlated, but the pattern of missing values in
column `3-0.0` is different to that of the other columns.


If we use the `nathres` option, FUNPACK will only remove columns where the
correlation of both present and missing values meet the thresholds. Note that
the column which contains more missing values will be the one that gets
removed:


```
funpack -apr all "removeIfRedundant(0.9, nathres=0.6)" out.tsv data_18.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


### Categorical binarisation


The `binariseCategorical` process takes a column containing categorical
labels, and replaces it with a set of new binary columns, one for each
category. Imagine that we have this data:


```
cat data_19.tsv
```


We can use the `binariseCategorical` process to split column `1-0.0` into a
separate column for each category:


```
funpack -apr 1 "binariseCategorical" out.tsv data_19.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


There are a few options to `binariseCategorical`, including controlling whether
the original column is removed, and also the naming of the newly created
columns:


```
funpack -apr 1 "binariseCategorical(replace=False, nameFormat='{vid}:{value}')" out.tsv data_19.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


## Custom cleaning, processing and loading - FUNPACK plugins


If you want to apply some specific cleaning or processing function to a
variable, you can code your functions up in python, and then tell FUNPACK to
apply them.


As an example, let's say we have some data like this:


```
cat data_20.tsv
```


### Custom cleaning functions


But for our analysis, we are only interested in the even values for columns 1
and 2. Let's write a cleaning function which replaces all odd values with NA:


```
cat plugin_1.py | pygmentize
```


To use our custom cleaner function, we simply pass our plugin file to FUNPACK
using the `--plugin_file` (`-p` for short) option:


```
funpack -p plugin_1.py -cl 1 drop_odd_values -cl 2 drop_odd_values out.tsv data_20.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


### Custom processing functions


Recall that **cleaning** functions are applied independently to each column,
whereas **processing** functions may be applied to multiple columns
simultaneously, and may add and/or remove columns. Let's say we want to derive
a new column from columns `1-0.0` and `2-0.0` in our example data set. Our
plugin file might look like this:


```
cat plugin_2.py | pygmentize
```


Again, to use our plugin, we pass it to FUNPACK via the `--plugin`/`-p`
option:


```
funpack -p plugin_2.py -apr "1,2" "sum_squares" out.tsv data_20.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


### Custom file loaders


You might want to load some auxillary data which is in an awkward format that
cannot be automatically parsed by FUNPACK. For example, you may have a file
which has acquisition date information separated into *year*, *month* and
*day* columns, e.g.:


```
cat data_21.tsv
```


These three columns would be better loaded as a single column. So we can write a
plugin to load this file for us. We need to write two functions:

 * A "sniffer" function, which returns information about the columns contained
   in the file.
 * A "loader" function which loads the file, returning it as a
   `pandas.DataFrame`.


```
cat plugin_3.py | pygmentize
```


And to see it in action:


```
funpack -p plugin_3.py -l data_21.tsv my_datefile_loader out.tsv data_21.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


## Miscellaneous topics


### Non-numeric data


Many UK Biobank variables contain non-numeric data, such as alpha-numeric
codes and unstructured text. If you want to select subjects on the basis of
such columns, [variable expressions](#Selecting-subjects-by-variable-value)
contain some simple mechanisms for doing so.  Here is an example of a file
containing both numeric and non-numeric data:


```
cat data_22.tsv | column -t -s $'\t'
```


Let's say we are only interested in subjects where variable 1 contains a value
in the `A` category:


> Note the use of the `-nb` (`--no_builtins`) option here - this tells
> FUNPACK to ignore its built-in variable table, which contains information
> about the type of each UK BioBank variable, and would otherwise interfere
> with this example. You would almost never need to use this option normally.


```
funpack -nb -s "v1 contains 'A'" out.tsv data_22.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


By default, FUNPACK will save columns containing non-numeric data to the
main output file, just like any other column. However, there are a couple of
options you can use to control what FUNPACK does with non-numeric data.


If you only care about numeric columns, you can use the
`--suppress_non_numerics` option (`-esn` for short) - this tells FUNPACK to
discard all columns that are not numeric:


```
funpack -nb -esn out.tsv data_22.tsv
cat out.tsv
```


You can also tell FUNPACK to save all non-numeric columns to a separate file,
using the `--write_non_numerics` option (`-wnn` for short):


```
funpack -nb -esn -wnn out.tsv data_22.tsv
cat out.tsv
cat out_non_numerics.tsv
```


### Dry run


The `--dry_run` (`-d` for short) option allows you to see what FUNPACK is
going to do - it is useful to perform a dry run before running a large
processing job, which could take a long time. For example, if we have a
complicated configuration such as the following, we can use the `--dry_run`
option to check that FUNPACK is going to do what we expect:


```
funpack                                  \
  -nb -d                                 \
  -nv  1   "7,8,9"                       \
  -re  2   "1,2,3" "100,200,300"         \
  -cv  3   "v4 != 20" "25"               \
  -cl  4   "makeNa('< 50')"              \
  -apr all "removeIfSparse(minpres=0.5)" \
  out.tsv data_01.tsv
```


### Built-in rules


FUNPACK has a large number of hand-crafted rules built in, which are
specific to variables found in the UK BioBank data set.  These rules are part
of the `fmrib` configuration, which can be used by adding `-cfg fmrib` to
the command-line options.


We can use the `--dry_run` (`-d` for short) option, along with some dummy data
files which just contain the UK BioBank column names, to get a summary of
these rules:


```
funpack -cfg fmrib -d out.tsv ukbcols.csv
```


All of these rules are coded in a set of `.cfg` and `.tsv` files which are
installed alongside the FUNPACK source code:


```
cfgdir=$(python -c "import funpack; print(funpack.findConfigDir())")
ls -l $cfgdir/
ls -l $cfgdir/fmrib/
```

The key files are:

 * `variables_*.tsv`: Child value replacement, and cleaning rules for each
   variable.
 * `datacodings_*.tsv`: NA insertion and recoding rules for data codings -
   these are used when rules are not explicitly specified in the
   `variables_*.tsv` files, for a variable which uses a given data coding.
 * `processing.tsv`: List of all processing functions that are applied, in
   order.
 * `categories.tsv`: Variable categories, for use with the `--category`/`-c`
   option.


> Note that these rules are released as a separate package called
> [fmrib-unpack-fmrib-config](https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/funpack-fmrib-config/),
> but are automatically installed when you install FUNPACK.


If you are not happy with some of the rules defined in these files, you have the
following options:

1. Override them on the command-line, or in a configuration file (see below)
2. Modify them in place.
3. Create your own versions of the files, and pass them via the following
   command-line options:

   * `--variable_file` (`-vf` for short)
   * `--datacoding_file` (`-df` for short)
   * `--type_file` (`-tf` for short)
   * `--processing_file` (`-pf` for short)
   * `--category_file` (`-cf` for short)


Rules which you provide on the command-line or via the `-vf` and `-df` options
will override built-in rules for the same variables/datacodings.


The variable and datacoding rules can be stored across multiple files - for
example, you may want to write all of the NA insertion rules in one file, and
all of the child value replacement rules in another. FUNPACK will merge
all of the built-in files and any additionally provided files together, so you
do not need to maintain large and unwieldy variable/datacoding tables.


### Using a configuration file


FUNPACK has an extensive command-line interface, but you don't need to pass
all of the settings via the command-line.  Instead, you can put them into a
file, and give that file to FUNPACK with the `--config` (`-cfg` for short)
option. You need to use the long-form of each command-line option, without the
leading `--`.


Let's take our example from the [dry run section](#Dry-run), and put all of
the options into a configuration file:


```
cat <<EOF > config.txt
no_builtins
quiet
overwrite
na_values      1   "7,8,9"
recoding       2   "1,2,3" "100,200,300"
child_values   3   "v4 != 20" "25"
clean          4   "makeNa('< 50')"
append_process all "removeIfSparse(minpres=0.5)"
EOF

cat config.txt
```


Now we can pass this file to FUNPACK instead of having to pass all of the
command line options:


```
funpack -d -cfg config.txt out.tsv data_01.tsv
```


### Working with unknown/uncategorised variables


Future UK BioBank data releases may contain new variables that are not present
in the built-in variable table used by FUNPACK, and thus are not recognised
as UKB variables.


Furthermore, if you are working with the hand-crafted variable categories from
the [built-in fmrib configuration](#Built-in-rules), or your own categories,
a new data release may contain variables which are not included in any
category.


To help you identify these new variables, FUNPACK has the ability to inform
you about variables that it does not know about, or that are not categorised.


To demonstrate, let's create a dummy variable table which lists all of the
variables that we do know about - variables 1 to 5. We'll also create a custom
category file, which adds variables 1 to 3 to a category:


```
echo -e "ID\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n"      > custom_variables.tsv
echo -e "ID\tCategory\tVariables"  > custom_categories.tsv
echo -e "1\tmy category\t1:3"     >> custom_categories.tsv
cat custom_variables.tsv
cat custom_categories.tsv
```


Now we can use the `--write_unknown_vars` option (`-wu` for short) to generate
a summary of the variables which FUNPACK did not recognise, or which were
not in any category:


> Again we are using the `-nb` (`--no_builtins`) option, which tells FUNPACK
> not to load its built-in table of UK BioBank variables.



```
funpack -nb -vf custom_variables.tsv -cf custom_categories.tsv -wu out.tsv data_01.tsv
cat out_unknown_vars.txt
```


This file contains a summary of the columns that were uncategorised or not
recognised, and whether they were exported to the output file. If an
unknown/uncategorised variable was not exported (e.g. it was removed during
[processing](#Processing-examples) by a sparsity or redundancy check), the
`exported` column will contain a `0` for that variable.


If you are specifically interested in querying or working with these
unknown/uncategorised variables, you can select them with the
automatically-generated `unknown`/`uncategorised` categories:


```
funpack -nb -vf custom_variables.tsv -cf custom_categories.tsv -c unknown       unknowns.tsv      data_01.tsv
funpack -nb -vf custom_variables.tsv -cf custom_categories.tsv -c uncategorised uncategorised.tsv data_01.tsv
echo "Unknown variables:"
cat unknowns.tsv
echo "Uncategorised variables:"
cat uncategorised.tsv
```
