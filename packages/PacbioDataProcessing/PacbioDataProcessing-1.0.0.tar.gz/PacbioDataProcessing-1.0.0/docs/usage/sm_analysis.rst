.. _sm-analysis:

Single molecule analysis with the ``sm-analysis`` program
=========================================================

``sm-analysis`` is the main program provided by |project|. It analyzes a
given input PacBio BAM file evaluating the methylation status of
each :term:`molecule`.

.. note::
   As mentioned in the :ref:`installation` section, by default only
   the :term:`command line interface <Command Line Interface (CLI)>` for
   the single molecule analysis, ``sm-analysis``, is installed. The
   corresponding :term:`graphical user interface <Graphical User Interface (GUI)>`
   can be enabled but requires an extra library: [wxpython]_.
   Both ``sm-analysis`` and ``sm-analysis-gui`` provide access to the
   same pipeline, the same program is run under the hood. They only differ
   in the interface.


Input
-----

``sm-analysis`` expects a PacBio BAM file as first input and the
corresponding :term:`FASTA` file containing the reference as the second
argument:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sm-analysis myseq.bam bacterium.fasta

Other options can be added to that line to customize the default behaviour.
For example, to speed up the analysis we might want to use more than one
*CPU core*. |project| allows us to run several instances of the
:ref:`ipdSummary <kineticsTools>` program in parallel. And we might also
let each :ref:`ipdSummary <kineticsTools>` instance use multiple *worker*
processes. The following line adds two
:term:`command line options <Command Line Option>` to do all that:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sm-analysis myseq.bam bacterium.fasta -N 3 -n 2

which, upon execution, will analize the given BAM file with the given reference
using ``3`` :ref:`ipdSummary <kineticsTools>` instances, and each instance
will use ``2`` worker processes in turn.

For a complete list of options available and their description, see the
section :ref:`clo_sm_analysis` below.


Output
------

Once the ``sm-analysis`` program runs successfully, some files are produced:

* a :ref:`summary report <summary-report>` with statistics about the
  *Single Molecule Analysis* process,
* a single :term:`molecule` summary of all the methylations found (see
  :ref:`methylation-report-format` for details),
* a file with the *low level* information of the analysis, the so-called
  :ref:`raw detections file <raw-detections-format>`, and
* a concatenated file made up of all the :term:`GFF` files produced
  by :ref:`ipdSummary <kineticsTools>` during the analysis.

   Flow chart of the ``sm-analysis`` program.


One of the first things that
the program will do is to ensure that this input BAM is aligned. Actually
two alignment processes will be carried out with the help of
:ref:`blasr` on the input BAM file, each one producing what we call an
:term:`alignment variant`. One is the *straight* alignment variant and
another is an alignment with a rotated reference, the so-called *pi shifted*
alignment variant, where the starting point of the
reference is rotated by 180 degrees. The aim of this second alignment
process is to catch molecules that cross the origin. With the help of those
two files a complete set of molecules can be detected.

Before running :ref:`blasr` the program will try to find the two aligned
versions of the input file, *if it is* unaligned.

On the other hand, if the input file is actually aligned, a *pi shifted*
version of it will be sought. And if found, it will be used.

If only a *straight* aligned file is at hand, the circular topology of the
reference will not be considered.

To find the aligned versions of the input BAM, the program tries to answer
three questions:

1. Is there a candidate with the expected filename?
2. Is the candidate aligned?
3. Are the molecules in it a subset of the molecules in the input BAM?

If the answer to the three questions is yes, the candidate is considered
a *plausible aligned version* of the input BAM, and it is as such used
within the rest of the analysis. If not, the alignment process is carried
out.


Filters
^^^^^^^

The ``sm-analysis`` program applies several filters to *each* :term:`molecule`
in the input BAM file. The aim is to ensure a minimum of quality in the
sequencing data for the processed molecules.
The following filters are applied, in the given order:

1. A minimum of ``50`` base pairs is required to each :term:`molecule`.
   The sequence corresponding to each molecule is taken from the
   aligned CCS BAM file.
2. A minimum of ``254`` for the mapping quality (column 5 in each
   :term:`subread`) is required to each :term:`molecule`.
3. At least 90% of the :term:`subreads <subread>` in each molecule
   must have a mapping of ``0`` or ``16``.
4. Only :term:`subreads <subread>` with mapping in the set ``{0, 16}``
   are taken.
5. Only :term:`molecules <molecule>` with:

   a. at least 20 :term:`subreads <subread>`, and
   b. data for both *strands* (``+`` and ``-``)

   are taken.

For details about the technical terms used in the description of the filters
(i.e. what is a *mapping* or what is the meaning of *mapping quality*),
please consult the `SAM/BAM format`_ specification.

.. _clo_sm_analysis:

Command line options
--------------------

The ``sm-analysis`` program has a :term:`Command Line Interface (CLI)`
with the following options:

.. program:: sm-analysis

.. option:: <BAM-FILE>

   Input file in BAM format


.. option:: <ALIGNMENT-FILE>

   Input file containing the alignment in FASTA format (typically a file
   ending in '.fa' or '.fasta'). A companion '.fa.fai'/'.fasta.fai' file
   is also needed but it will be created if not found.


.. option:: -M <MODEL>, --ipd-model <MODEL>

   Model to be used by ipdSummary to identify the type of modification. MODEL
   must be either the model name or the path to the ipd model. First, the
   program will make an attempt to interprete MODEL as a path to a file
   defining a model; if that fails, MODEL will be understood to be the name
   of a model that must be accessible in the resources directory of
   :ref:`kineticsTools` (e.g. ``-M SP3-C3`` would trigger a search for a
   file called ``SP3-C3.npz.gz`` within the directory with models provided
   by :ref:`kineticsTools`). If this option is not given, the default model
   in ipdSummary is used.


.. option:: -b <PATH>, --blasr-path <PATH>

   Path to the :ref:`blasr` program. If not given, the program is expected
   to be found in the path.


.. option:: -p <PATH>, --pbindex-path <PATH>

   Path to the :ref:`pbindex` program. If not given, the program is expected
   to be found in the path.


.. option:: -i <PATH>, --ipdsummary-path <PATH>

   Path to the ``ipdSummary`` program (see :ref:`kineticsTools`). If not given,
   the program is expected to be found in the path.


.. option:: -c <PATH>, --ccs-path <PATH>

   Path to the :ref:`ccs` program. If not given, the program is expected
   to be found in the path.


.. option:: -N <INT>, --num-simultaneous-ipdsummarys <INT>

   Number of simultaneous instances of ipdSummary that will
   cooperate to process the molecules (default: 1).


.. option:: -n <INT>, --num-workers-per-ipdsummary <INT>

   Number of worker processes that each instance of ipdSummary will
   spawn (default: 1).


.. option:: --nprocs-blasr <INT>

   Number of worker processes that each instance of blasr will
   spawn (default: 1).


.. option:: -P <PARTITION:NUMBER-OF-PARTITIONS>, --partition <PARTITION:NUMBER-OF-PARTITIONS>

   This option instructs the program to only analyze a fraction
   (partition) of the molecules present in the input bam file. The
   file is divided in `NUMBER OF PARTITIONS` (almost) equal pieces
   but ONLY the PARTITION-th partition (fraction) is analyzed.
   For instance, `--partition 3:7` means that the bam file is
   divided in seven pieces but only the third piece is analyzed
   by the current instance of sm-analysis. By default, all the file
   is analyzed.


.. option:: -C <PATH>, --CCS-bam-file <PATH>

   The CCS file in BAM format can be optionally provided;
   otherwise it is computed. It is necessary to create the
   reference mapping between *hole numbers* and the DNA sequence
   of the corresponding fragment, or *molecule*. After being
   aligned, the file will be also used to determine the position
   of each molecule in the report of methylation states. If the
   CCS BAM file is provided, and any of the necessary aligned
   versions of it is not found, the CCS file will be aligned to
   be able to get the positions. If this option is not used, a
   CCS BAM will be generated from the original BAM file using
   the ``ccs`` program.


.. option:: --keep-temp-dir

   Should we keep a copy of the temporary files generated?
   (default: No).


.. option:: -m <MOD-TYPE>, --modification-types <MOD-TYPE>

   Focus only in the requested modification types (default: m6A).
   Multiple space-separated values can be given.


.. option:: --only-produce-methylation-report

   Use this flag to only produce the methylation report from the
   per detection csv file (default: No).


.. option:: -v, --verbose

   Run the program in *verbose mode* such that much more runtime
   details are produced.





Graphical User Interface: ``sm-analysis-gui``
---------------------------------------------

Despite the power, beauty and *vintage* flavor of the command line, |project| offers
a :term:`Graphical User Interface (GUI)` for its main executable ``sm-analysis``:
``sm-analysis-gui`` which, upon execution, will open a window that will allow
you to drive the single molecule analysis.
