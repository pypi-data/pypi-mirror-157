This module includes integration classes for using Topics, Queues or Lambdas
as S3 Notification Destinations.

## Examples

The following example shows how to send a notification to an SNS
topic when an object is created in an S3 bucket:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_sns as sns


bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "Bucket")
topic = sns.Topic(self, "Topic")

bucket.add_event_notification(s3.EventType.OBJECT_CREATED_PUT, s3n.SnsDestination(topic))
```

The following example shows how to send a notification to an SQS queue
when an object is created in an S3 bucket:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_sqs as sqs


bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "Bucket")
queue = sqs.Queue(self, "Queue")

bucket.add_event_notification(s3.EventType.OBJECT_CREATED_PUT, s3n.SqsDestination(queue))
```

The following example shows how to send a notification to a Lambda function when an object is created in an S3 bucket:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_lambda as lambda_


bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "Bucket")
fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_12_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler"))
)

bucket.add_event_notification(s3.EventType.OBJECT_CREATED, s3n.LambdaDestination(fn))
```
