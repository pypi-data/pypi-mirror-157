## Serenity SDK - Python

### Introduction

The Serenity digital asset risk platform exposes all functionality via an API -- currently REST only.

Although it's possible to call the API with simple HTTP client code in most any modern language, there
are conventions that need to be followed -- especially for authentication and authorization -- and to
make it easier we have provided this lightweight SDK.

### Learning more

At this time the API and its documentation are only available to members of our private beta, via
their personal Serenity Developer Portal, e.g. https://developer.$client.cloudwall.network.
