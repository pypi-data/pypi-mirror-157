"""
This module contains HEA objects supporting items that are openable in the HEA desktop, called data objects (DataObject
below). HEA uses internet MIME types to provide additional information about the type of data in a DataObject. You can
read more about MIME types at https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type.

HEA defines the following custom MIME types that are intended only for internal use by the different parts of HEA:

application/x.folder: HEA folders (heaobject.folder.Folder)
application/x.item: HEA items (heaobject.folder.Item)
application/x.data-in-database: Data in a database (heaobject.data.DataInDatabase)
