# umls-client

python umls client

## Description
light umls client with rate limiting


## Installation
    pip install umls-client

## Usage
    resolver = UMLSClient("API_KEY")
    r0 = resolver.search_string("olfactory receptor")
    print(r0.result)
    r0.has_next_page() # True
    r0_a = resolver.search_string("olfactory receptor", page=99)
    r0_a.has_next_page() # False

    r1 = resolver.search_cui("C1518565")
    # r1.result = {...}
    r2_a = resolver.search_cui("C1518565", CuiExtension.RELATIONS)
    # r2_a.result = [{...},{...},{...}]
    r3 = resolver.search_tui("T104")
    # r3.result = {...}
