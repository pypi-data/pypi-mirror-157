Description: This package does summary analysis when data accepted from the client and compares the structure with the reference file. In many practical data science project we had to feed same structure data in the analysis process in regular interval. This package could be helpful for users to check the data structure before feed into the production process or somewhere else. 
        
        ## How to use:
        
        import DataQC
        from DataQC import Quick_QC
        Quick_QC(INPUT_LOCATION,OUTPUT_LOCATION,REF_LOCATION,SEP)

        ## Outputs
