**This library is based on the old Eventline SaaS platform, and does not work
with the new open source stand-alone Eventline server.**

# Introduction
This repository contains the Python SDK for the
[Eventline](https://www.exograd.com/products/eventline) platform.

# Examples
The `examples` directory contains scripts demonstrating various use cases for
the `eventline` package. All of them expect the `EVENTLINE_API_KEY` to be set.
