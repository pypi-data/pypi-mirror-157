Python "xweights" contains functions to calculate grid weighted area means from predefined regions or from an user-given shapefile. This tool is a wrapper around the python package xesmf https://xesmf.readthedocs.io

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://xweights.readthedocs.io


Features
--------

* Calculate grid-weighted-means and save the output as CSV file

* As input you can choose between files on disk and intake-esm catalogues. Xarray dataset input is under development.

* Use all these features as an command-line tool too


Installation
------------

You can install the package directly with pip:

.. code-block:: console

     pip install xweights

If you want to contribute, I recommend cloning the repository and installing the package in development mode, e.g.

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/ludwiglierhammer/xweights.git
    cd xweights
    pip install -e .

In additon you have to install xESMF using _Conda:

.. code-block:: console

    conda install -c conda-forge xesmf

This will install the package but you can still edit it and you don't need the package in your :code:`PYTHONPATH`


Requirements
------------

* python3.6 or higher

* numpy

* pandas

* geopandas

* intake-esm

* xarray

* py-cordex

* xesmf
