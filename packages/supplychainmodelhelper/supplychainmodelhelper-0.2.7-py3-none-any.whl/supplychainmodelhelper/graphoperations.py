"""

purpose: create graph from specifications of the user with
generally used node properties used in supply chain models



Functions:
----------
directly operating on network
* createGraph - the graph is created with node attributes 'actors','locations',
'products'
* getListOfNodeIDs - returns a list of nodeIDs with the corresponding
attributes, used for editing information on the graph
* getNodeIDswAttr - returns a tuple of (nodeIDs,attributes) with the
corresponding attributes, used for editing information on the graph
* addAttr2ExistingNodes - adds a user specified attribute to the nodes of the
network
* addAttr2Edges - adds a user specified attribute to the edges of the network
* getEdgeID - returns the IDs for the edges on the graph, given the user
specified nodes (IDs given by getListOfNodeIDs) on the network
* getEdgesAttr - returns a list of attributes of the edges (IDs given by
getEdgeID) specified by the user
* getEdgeIDswAttr - returns a tuple of
((edge ID, attribute) = (node out,node in, attribute)) of the edges (IDs given
by getEdgeID) specified by the user
* getExistingAttrs - returns a list of existing attributes on the graph
(either nodes or edges)

toolkit for handling attributes on the network
* combineActorBrand - if an actor consists of different subtypes (e.g.
    warehouse and brand(ALDI,REWE, etc.)), then this function helps with a fast
    way of creating additional actors, before creating the network
* convertLoT2NTs - functions like getEdgeIDswAttr, return a list of tuples, but
    only a part of this is needed. This function accepts a list of tuples as
    input and returns 2 lists with the same order as before.
* convertTup2LoT - functions like addAttr2ExistingNodes, accept a list of
    tuples as input, but only a list available. This function accepts 2 lists
    as input and returns a list on tuples with the same order as before.
* getAllCombinations - getEdgeID is a function that has the corresponding nodes
    as input, and returns a direct  1-to-1 list (node out, node in). If all
    possible combinations of edges between 2 nodes are to be returned, this
    function helps with that.
* convertMatrix - 2 applications:
    1. for calibration might be needed if calibration measure is of different
        dimension as the calculated flows
    2. if a matrix with redundant information needs to be created from a matrix
        with minimum information (e.g. similar geographical distances between
        nodes to be put into a distance matrix)

mapping raw data objects to network data objects
* proxyModel - simple fraction model. If data for correlated variable is
    available, this model may be used to use the proxy data to model the data
    in question (e.g. modellled data = produced eggs, proxy data= number of
    laying hens)
* getDistMatrix - accesses the graph for attribute 'distance' for
    user-specified nodes, return a dataframe containing information of the
    geographical distance between the locations of given nodes (needs to be
    entered into the graph beforehand via the function addAttr2Edges)
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges of the
    participating nodes.
* optFlow, minOptFlowForBeta - calculating and minimizing the optimal flow
    given supply and demand of a product and the distance between participating
    nodes. Needed for calculating minimum transport distance (see
    calcPotTransportDistances).
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges of
    the participating nodes.
    NOTE that the attribute 'output' needs to be defined on the nodes
    supplying the product.
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges of the
    participating nodes.
* propFlow - calculating the proportional flow given supply and demand of a
    product and the distance between participating nodes. Needed for
    calculating maximum transport distance (see calcPotTransportDistances).
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges of the
    participating nodes.
    NOTE that the attribute 'output' needs to be defined on the nodes
    supplying the product.
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges of
    the participating nodes.
* furnessModel - given geographical distance, supply and demand of the
    participating nodes and the free parameter (resistance factor) beta this
    function returns the flow between given nodes
    (beta needs to be determined by hymanModel / calibration)
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges of
    the participating nodes.
    NOTE that the attribute 'output' needs to be defined on the nodes
    supplying the product.
    NOTE that the attribute 'input' needs to be defined on the nodes
    demanding the product.
* calcPotTransportDistances - calculates the range of possible average
    transport distances and returns a list of values within this interval.
    The number of returned values from this interval may be specified by the
    user (needed for hymanModel to determine beta for furnessModel).
    NOTE that each of the returned values are POSSIBLE average transport
    distance. The best one still needs to be determined(see calibration).
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges of
    the participating nodes.
    NOTE that the attribute 'output' needs to be defined on the nodes
    supplying the product.
    NOTE that the attribute 'input' needs to be defined on the nodes
    demanding the product.
* hymanModel - calculates resistance factor beta given a transport distance.
    Returns the flow between participating nodes of supply and demand.
    NOTE that each of the returned values are POSSIBLE average transport
    distance. The best one still needs to be determined(see calibration).
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges of
    the participating nodes.
    NOTE that the attribute 'output' needs to be defined on the nodes
    supplying the product.
    NOTE that the attribute 'input' needs to be defined on the nodes
    demanding the product.
* getWeightedDist - returns the average transport distance, given the flow
    between participating nodes of supply and demand.
    NOTE that each of the returned values are POSSIBLE average transport
    distance. The best one still needs to be determined(see calibration).
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges of
    the participating nodes.
    NOTE that the attribute 'output' needs to be defined on the nodes
    supplying the product.
    NOTE that the attribute 'input' needs to be defined on the nodes
    demanding the product.
* calibration - function for calculating the best configuration of given
    transport distances
    and corresponding flows. A number of possible average transport
    distances are given by the function calcPotTransportDistances. The
    function hymanModel calculates the corresponding flows.
    Now this needs to be calibrated against a measure to determine which
    average transport distance fits best the calibration measure.
    This function accepts a 4D-Tensor of all flows as input [supply,demand,
    product,transport distance]
    and the calibration measure in question.
    NOTE that each of the returned values are POSSIBLE average transport
    distance. The best one still
    needs to be determined(see calibration).
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges of
    the participating nodes.
    NOTE that the attribute 'output' needs to be defined on the nodes
    supplying the product.
    NOTE that the attribute 'input' needs to be defined on the nodes
    demanding the product.

* calibrationOLD - deprecated function for calculating the best
    configuration of given transport distances and corresponding flows. MCMC
    simulation. Only here for reasons of nostalgia.

    """
    purpose: This model maps raw data onto the graph via proxy data.
    A proportional equation is solved:
    networkData / inputNr = proxyData / proxyData.

    example:
    If you have the national production of eggs and want to map this
    on your network model with a location resolution on a county level and
    you have the data for how many chicken live in each county, you could come
    up with a proxyModel saying the number of chicken is proportional to the
    eggs produced in this county.
    Then:
    inputNr is the national production of eggs(float), proxyData is the number
    of chicken in each county(list) and proxyNr is the sum of all chicken in
    all counties. The returned list is then the modelled production of eggs
    in each county.

    Shorter version of this example:
    inputNr = national production of eggs
    proxyData = list of tuples of (NodeID, number of chicken in each location)
         this can also be just a list, but you get a warning if you do that
    proxyNr = total number of chicken
    inputNr/ModelData = proxyNr/proxyData ->
    ModelData = proxyData/proxyNr*inputNr

    :param inputNr: float. (usage see explanation above)

    """
    purpose: [DEPRECATED] calculate the flow of goods, based on a transport
    distance (got from calcPotTransportDistances), by estimating unkown beta.
    Hardcoded here is the exponential distance model, input for furnessModel
    (see furnessModel for details).
    The hymanModel allows to calculate the flow if the average transport
    distance is known. Unfortunately only a range of possible average
    transport distances for each product are known (and may be calculated by
    the
    function calcPotTransportDistances).
    In Germany a Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan(FTIP) exists, that gives
    information about how much food is transported in average from
    one county to another.
    For this to be possible to be calibrated against the flow of all
    products involved needs to summed up.
    calcPotTransportDistances returns for every product a number of possible
    average transport distances (m).

    Manual: create a 4D-numpy array
    >> import numpy as np
    >> np.ndarray(
        (rowsOfFlow, colsOfFlow, nrOfProducts, nrOfTransportationDistances)
    )
    with
    - rowsOfFlow, colsOfFlow defined by the dimensions of your flow matrix
    - nrOfProducts as the number of products in your supply chain
    - nrOfTransportationDistances as the number of transport distances from
    calcPotTransportDistances
    This creates one of the inputs for this function: flowTensor
    The other is the calibration measure (expected is of dimension
    [rowsOfFlow,colsOfFlow]).
    If you have a calibration measure differing from your flows, consider
    using convertMatrix from this toolkit to convert your flow to the dimension
    of calibrationMatrix.



    If for all products and all available transport distance(m) a
    flow_product_m is calculated via hymanModel, then this function chooses
    randomly an ensemble of all flow_product_m, then tries to minimize the
    difference to FTIP by switching out flow_product_<m> following a
    metropolis MC-algorithm scheme.

    The formula involved
    Min(sum_products abs(flow_products_[m] - FTIP))

    If sum_products abs(flow_products_[m_NEW] - FTIP) =<
                sum_products abs(flow_products_[m_OLD] - FTIP)
        Then m_Current = m_NEW
    Else If sum_products abs(flow_products_[m_NEW] - FTIP) >
                sum_products abs(flow_products_[m_OLD] - FTIP)
        prob = (-(exp(sum_products abs(flow_products_[m_NEW] - FTIP) >
                    sum_products abs(flow_products_[m_OLD] - FTIP))))
        If prob < random_uniform(0,1)

    [output,input,product,member of the ensemble]
    :param calibrationMatrix: calibration measure
    :param nrIter(optional): maximum number of iterations (default 100,000).
    Note that, the algorithm ends the minimization routine if for wait
    iterations nothing has changed.
    :param wait(optional): number of iterations waiting for something to change
    (default: 1,000). Kicks in only after 10% of maximum iterations are done.

    :return listOfBestEnsembleConfiguration: a list of ids that correspond to
    the transport distances m. For each product a specific m was chosen,
    so that the difference between the input flows and the calibration
    measure in minimized.

    """
    purpose: calibrate the calculated flow against a calibration measure
    calculate the flow of goods, based on a transport distance
    (got from calcPotTransportDistances), by estimating the free and
    unknown parameter beta (see furnessModel).
    Hardcoded here is the exponential distance model, input for furnessModel
    (see furnessModel for details).
    The hymanModel allows to calculate the flow if the average transport
    distance is known. Unfortunately only a range of possible average
    transport distances for each product are known (and may be calculated by
    the function calcPotTransportDistances).
    In Germany a Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan(FTIP) exists, that gives
    information about how much food is transported in average from
    one county to another.
    For this to be calibrated against the flow of all products involved needs
    to summed up. calcPotTransportDistances returns for every product a number
    of possible average transport distances (m).

    Manual for input: create a 4D-numpy array for the input parameter
    flowTensor

    >> import numpy as np
    >> np.ndarray((
        rowsOfFlow,
        colsOfFlow,
        nrOfProducts,
        nrOfTransportationDistances
    ))

    with
    - rowsOfFlow, colsOfFlow defined by the dimensions of your flow matrix
    - nrOfProducts as the number of products in your supply chain
    - nrOfTransportationDistances as the number of transport distances from
    calcPotTransportDistances

    The other is the calibration measure (expected is of dimension
    [rowsOfFlow,colsOfFlow]).
    If you have a calibration measure differing from your flows, consider using
    convertMatrix from this toolkit to convert your flow to the dimension of
    the parameter calibrationMatrix.

    The formula involved in this algorithm to find the best possible
    transport distance (m):
    Min(abs(sum_products abs(flow_products_[m] - FTIP)))


    :param flowTensor: 4D tensor numpy.ndarray [i,j,p,m] = [output, input,
    product, member of the ensemble]
    :param calibrationMatrix: calibration measure of dimension [output, input]

    :return listOfBestEnsembleConfiguration: a list of ids that correspond to
    the transport distances m. For each product a specific m was chosen,
    so that the difference between the input flows and the calibration
    measure in minimized.
    May be accessed via the command
    >> flowTensor[0:output,0:input,0:products,listOfBestEnsembleConfiguration]
