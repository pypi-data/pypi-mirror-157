purpose: create graph from specifications of the user with 
generally used node properties used in supply chain models



Methods:
----------
directly operating on network
* createGraph - the graph is created with node attributes
    'actors','locations','products'
* getlist_node_ids - returns a list of nodeIDs with the corresponding
    attributes, used for editing information on the graph
* getNodeIDswAttr - returns a tuple of (nodeIDs,attributes) with the
    corresponding attributes, used for editing information on the graph
* addAttr2ExistingNodes - adds a user specified attribute to the nodes
    of the network
* addAttr2Edges - adds a user specified attribute to the edges of the network
* getEdgeID - returns the IDs for the edges on the graph, given the user
    specified nodes (IDs given by getlist_node_ids) on the network
* getEdgesAttr - returns a list of attributes of the edges
    (IDs given by getEdgeID) specified by the user
* getEdgeIDswAttr - returns a tuple of
    ((edge ID, attribute) = (node out,node in, attribute))
    of the edges (IDs given by getEdgeID) specified by the user
* getExistingAttrs - returns a list of existing attributes on the graph
    (either nodes or edges)

toolkit for handling attributes on the network
* combineActorBrand - if an actor consists of different subtypes
    (e.g. warehouse and brand(ALDI,REWE, etc.)), then this function helps
    with a fast way of creating additional actors, before creating the network
* convertLoT2NTs - functions like getEdgeIDswAttr, return a list of
    tuples, but only a part of this is needed. This function accepts a list
    of tuples as input and returns 2 lists with the same order as before.
* convertTup2LoT - functions like addAttr2ExistingNodes, accept a list
    of tuples as input, but only a list available. This function accepts
    2 lists as input and returns a list on tuples with the same order as
    before.
* getAllCombinations - getEdgeID is a function that has the corresponding
    nodes as input, and returns a direct  1-to-1 list (node out, node in).
    If all possible combinations of edges between 2 nodes are to be
    returned, this function helps with that.
* convertMatrix - 2 applications:
    1. for calibration might be needed if calibration measure is
    of different dimension as the calculated flows
    2. if a matrix with redundant information needs to be created
    from a matrix with minimum information (e.g. similar geographical
    distances between nodes to be put into a distance matrix)

mapping raw data objects to network data objects
* proxyModel - simple fraction model. If data for correlated variable
    is available, this model may be used to use the proxy data to model
    the data in question
    (e.g. modellled data = produced eggs, proxy data= number of laying hens)
* getDistMatrix - accesses the graph for attribute 'distance' for
    user-specified nodes, return a dataframe containing information of the
    geographical distance between the locations of given nodes (needs to be
    entered into the graphe beforehand via the function addAttr2Edges)
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges
    of the participating nodes.
* optFlow, minOptFlowForBeta - calculating and minimizing the optimal
    flow given supply and demand of a product and the distance between
    participating nodes. Needed for calculating minimum transport
    distance (see calcPotTransportDistances).
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges
        of the participating nodes.
    NOTE that the attribute 'output' needs to be defined on the nodes
        supplying the product.
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges
        of the participating nodes.
* propFlow - calculating the proportional flow given supply and demand
    of a product and the distance between participating nodes. Needed for
    calculating maximum transport distance (see calcPotTransportDistances).
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges
        of the participating nodes.
    NOTE that the attribute 'output' needs to be defined on the nodes
        supplying the product.
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges
        of the participating nodes.
* furnessModel - given geographical distance, supply and demand of
    the participating nodes and the free parameter (resistance factor)
    beta this function returns the flow between given nodes
    (beta needs to be determined by hymanModel / calibration)
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges
        of the participating nodes.
    NOTE that the attribute 'output' needs to be defined on the nodes
        supplying the product.
    NOTE that the attribute 'input' needs to be defined on the nodes
        demanding the product.
* calcPotTransportDistances - calculates the range of possible average
    transport distances and returns a list of values within this interval.
    The number of returned values from this interval may be specified by
    the user (needed for hymanModel to determine beta for furnessModel).
    NOTE that each of the returned values are POSSIBLE average
    transport distance. The best one still needs to be determined(see
    calibration).
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the
        edges of the participating nodes.
    NOTE that the attribute 'output' needs to be defined on the nodes
        supplying the product.
    NOTE that the attribute 'input' needs to be defined on the nodes
        demanding the product.
* hymanModel - calculates resistance factor beta given a transport
    distance. Returns the flow between participating nodes of supply and
    demand.
    NOTE that each of the returned values are POSSIBLE average transport
        distance. The best one still needs to be determined(see calibration).
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges
        of the participating nodes.
    NOTE that the attribute 'output' needs to be defined on the nodes
        supplying the product.
    NOTE that the attribute 'input' needs to be defined on the nodes
        demanding the product.
* getWeightedDist - returns the average transport distance, given the flow
    between participating nodes of supply and demand.
    NOTE that each of the returned values are POSSIBLE average
        transport distance. The best one still needs to be determined(see
        calibration).
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges
        of the participating nodes.
    NOTE that the attribute 'output' needs to be defined on the nodes
        supplying the product.
    NOTE that the attribute 'input' needs to be defined on the nodes
        demanding the product.
* calibration - function for calculating the best configuration of given
    transport distances and corresponding flows. A number of possible
    average transport distances are given by the function
    calcPotTransportDistances. The function hymanModel calculates
    the corresponding flows.
    Now this needs to be calibrated against a measure to determine which
    average transport distance fits best the calibration measure.
    This function accepts a 4D-Tensor of all flows as input
    [supply,demand,product,transport distance] and the calibration measure
    in question.
    NOTE that each of the returned values are POSSIBLE average
        transport distance. The best one still needs to be determined(see
        calibration).
    NOTE that the attribute 'distance' needs to be defined on the edges
        of the participating nodes.
    NOTE that the attribute 'output' needs to be defined on the nodes
        supplying the product.
    NOTE that the attribute 'input' needs to be defined on the nodes
        demanding the product.

* calibrationOLD - deprecated function for calculating the best
    configuration of given transport distances and corresponding flows.

        If you have the national production of eggs and want to map this
        on your network model with a location resolution on a county level and
        you have the data for how many chicken live in each county, you could come
        up with a proxyModel saying the number of chicken is proportional to the

        inputNr is the national production of eggs(float), proxyData is the number
        of chicken in each county(list) and proxyNr is the sum of all chicken in
        all counties. The returned list is then the modelled production of eggs
        in each county.

        inputNr = national production of eggs
        proxyData = list of tuples of (NodeID, number of chicken in each location)
             this can also be just a list, but you get a warning if you do that

        all possible combinations yourself or make use of
