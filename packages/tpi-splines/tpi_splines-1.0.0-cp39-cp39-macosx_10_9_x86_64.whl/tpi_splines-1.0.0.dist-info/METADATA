# Introduction

The TPI package implements tensor spline interpolation in arbitrary dimensions.

The package provides two classes

BsplineBasis1D: 
  * Calculates the B-spline basis for a 1-dimensional knots vector.
  * Constructs the spline matrix.
  * The splines are cubic and use not-a-knot boundary conditions.

TP_Interpolant_ND:
  * Provides setup and solution of tensor product spline problems in N dimensions.
  * Sets up spline data structures for a Cartesian product grid.
  * Computes the spline coefficients given data for a scalar gridfunction.
  * Carries interpolates the griddata at a desired point in the parameter space 
    spanned by the grid.
  * Spline coefficient data can be returned or set, so that the setup and solution of 
    the interpolation problem can be separated, by writing the coefficient data to disk.

# Installation

To install to the system python folder run

```
  python setup.py build_ext
  sudo python setup.py install
```

If you do not have admin rights you can install locally

```
  python setup.py build_ext
  python setup.py build_ext install --user
```

You can create a source distribution and then install the package with pip
```
python setup.py sdist
pip install --user
```

or you can build the package using
```
python3 -m build
```


You can also install the package via https://pypi.org/project/tpi-splines/.

TPI supports Python 3. Unit tests can be run with pytest.


## Dependencies

TPI requires GSL, the GNU Scientific Library.
The project homepage is http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/


TPI now supports gsl 2.x (It has been tested with gsl 2.7.1).
```
gsl-config --version
```

On OS X you can use "brew" (https://brew.sh/) to install gsl.
Note that the "brew switch" command which could be used to select a particular version of a software package, no longer exists.
