        If an application_name is in our include or exclude filters we will either ignore or
        process the workflow updates for that application.

        Once an application_name is provided we retrieve the workflow for that application from
        our workflow_dict. Additionally we retrieve the destination workflow for the provided
        application.

        We create a temporary object that compares the stages of a source workflow to a destination
        workflow. If they are exactly the same we skip updating the workflow. If they are not, we
        copy the source workflow to the destination and update it to reflect the new workflow ID.

        Finally we update the destination workflow with our changes.
