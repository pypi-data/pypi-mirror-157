# pyElli
PyElli is a numerical solver for spectral ellipsometry employing well-known 2x2 and 4x4 algorithms.
It is intended for a broad case of problems including simple fitting of layered structures, anisotropic layers and any other light interaction with layered 1D structures.
It serves as a system for the day to day ellipsometry task at hand and makes fitting a breeze.

## Features
- A multitude of models to approximate the dielectric function of your material.
- Build up your structure easily from materials and layers.
- Simulate reflection and transmission spectra, ellipsometric parameters and Mueller matrices.
- Utilities to quickly convert, plot and fit your measurement data.
- Powerful when necessary, editable and expandable.

## How to get it
The installers for all releases are available at the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pyElli/).

To install run:
```sh
pip install pyElli
```

A complete environment for pyElli is also available as a [Docker Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/domna/pyelli).
From a running Docker installation simply run:
```sh
docker pull domna/pyelli
```

To install the latest development version use:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/PyEllips/pyElli.git
```

The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/PyEllips/pyElli), to manually install from source, download and run inside the downloaded folder:
```sh
python setup.py install
```
