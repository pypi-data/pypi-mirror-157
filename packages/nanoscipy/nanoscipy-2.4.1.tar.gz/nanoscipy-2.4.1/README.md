# nanoscipy

nanoscipy has been made, to ease the more heavy data-handling, -processing, and - analysis. 
This package is being readily updated at the moment, so be sure to keep up, as new and useful additions and fixes are very likely to be included.

## Installation and updating
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install nanoscipy like below. 
Rerun this command to check for and install  updates .
```bash
pip install nanoscipy
```
For package updates, use:
```bash
pip install --upgrade nanoscipy
```
Note that if you're using anaconda, you might have to install the module from the anaconda terminal instead (or use conda rather than pip)
## Usage
### Import
Do note that the module currently consists of three sub-modules, and so unless you are importing the entire module, you will need to specify either
```bash
import nanoscipy.functions
```
```bash
import nanoscipy.modules
```
or
```bash
import nanoscipy.mathpar
```
Note that the .functions sub-module contains all basic functions of this package, whilst the .modules sub-module contains all python classes of the package.
