# UpgradePipPkgs

> Tool for upgrading all `pip` packages within a Python environment using just one command.

---

## About

- **_`UpgradePipPkgs`_** can upgrade all of your `pip` packages using one of two methods:

  **Method 1:**

  > **First gather all outdated packages using the command `pip list --outdated`, then pass results to a list of outdated packages to be upgraded.**

  - This method is generally more efficient than the following method, as only outdated packages are passed to upgrade process.
  - Unfortunately doesn't take into account package dependencies relying on specific package versions to function properly.

  ---

  **Method 2:**

  > **Iterate over _all_ installed packages, passing the command `pip install --upgrade {pkgname}` over each one.**

  - This method takes more time overall, but is _"safer"_.
  - _"Safer"_ in this context means that package dependencies are corrected upon attempting upgrade on a package that specifies its dependencies, downgrading specific package versions where necessary.
  - Note that **not all packages will be able to downgrade**, as the order of packages upgraded is relevant to whether incorrect version dependencies are corrected.
    - For example, let's assume **`PackA`** requires **`PackB<=1.0.0`** as a dependency:
      1. **`PackA`** will be checked for available upgrade first, and will check for installed dependency pkg **`PackB<=1.0.0`**, installing it if not already installed.
      2. `PackB` is then checked, and has a new version available, `1.1.0`.
      3. `PackB-1.0.0` is then upgraded to `1.1.0`, but now `PackA` can't function correctly due to incorrect dependency version.
      4. This can easily be fixed by reinstalling `PackA` using the `pip` install command: "`pip install PackA`".

- You can review past results/program output in the application's log file, which can be found here:

### **Manual Installation**

> _Not_ recommended.

1. Before use, navigate to intended installation location, and create a new directory.

2. Clone repository with the git client of your preference.

3. Install all dependencies for this package within said directory by entering the following:

   ```shell
     pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

- **(Optional)** move installation directory to `"~/path/to/Python/Libs/site_packages"` to be able to import this package to a Python program like any other importable package.

**Done!**
