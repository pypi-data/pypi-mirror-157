# CutiePy

CutiePy is an **open source job scheduler for Python**. CutiePy allows you to:

* **enqueue a job** to run immediately
* **create scheduled jobs** that will run once at a later time
* **create recurring jobs** that will run periodically at a fixed interval, like a [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) job.

CutiePy ships with a **real-time monitoring dashboard** to help you track your jobs and workers.

# Contributing

CutiePy is currently not open to contribution.
I need some time to think about copyright for outside contributions.
I will also need to write a Contributor Licensing Agreement (CLA).
Until then, CutiePy will be closed to contributions.
