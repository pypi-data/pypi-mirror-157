**SYNOPSIS**

**DESCRIPTION**

 **GENOCIDE** is a solid, non hackable bot, that runs under systemd as a 
 24/7 background service starts after reboot and is intended to be programmable
 in a static, only code, no popen, no user imports and no reading modules from
 a directory, way. It can show genocide and suicide stats of king netherlands
 his genocide into a IRC channel, display rss feeds and log simple text
 messages, source is :ref:`here <source>`.

 **GENOCIDE** holds evidence that king netherlands is doing a genocide, a 
 written :ref:`response <guilty>` where king netherlands confirmed taking note
 of “what i have written”, namely :ref:`proof <evidence>` that medicine he
 uses in treatement laws like zyprexa, haldol, abilify and clozapine are poison
 that make impotent, is both physical (contracted muscles) and mental (let 
 people hallucinate) torture and kills members of the victim groups. 

 **GENOCIDE** contains :ref:`correspondence <request>` with the
 International Criminal Court, asking for arrest of the king of the 
 netherlands, for the genocide he is committing with his new treatement laws.
 Current status is an outside the jurisdiction judgement of the prosecutor 
 which requires a :ref:`reconsider <reconsider>` to have the king actually
 arrested.
