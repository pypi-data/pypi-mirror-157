.SH NAME
.P
hkfind - find \fBsxhkd\fR(1) hotkeys that match a search expression
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBhkfind\fR [options.\&.\&.\&] [\fIexpression\fR]
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBhkfind\fR searches a \fBsxhkdrc\fR file for keybinds that match a given
expression, similar in spirit to \fBfind\fR(1).\&  It writes the hotkeys for
the matching keybinds to standard output.\&  If \fIexpression\fR is omitted,
all keybinds are matched.\&
.P
See \fBsxhkd-parser\fR(7) for important background information needed to
use this tool.\&
.P
.SH OPTIONS
.P
Run \fBhkfind --help\fR.\&
.P
.SH EXPRESSION
.P
After the options, the search expression may be entered.\&  \fBhkfind\fR
accepts a similar expression syntax as \fBfind\fR(1), but is much simpler.\&
An expression is composed of:
.P
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
Predicates: The filters against which the keybinds are matched.\&
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
Operators: Join predicates together as a logical expression.\&

.RE
.P
The expression evaluates against each permutation of a keybind.\&  Only when
the whole expression evaluates to true for a permutation of a keybind
does its hotkey get written to standard output.\&
.P
.SS PREDICATES
.P
-cmd \fIcommand\fR ;
.RS 4
Execute \fIcommand\fR; true if 0 status is returned.\&  An empty
\fIcommand\fR is forbidden.\&  Replaces all occurrences of the hotkey
replacement string (\fB-H\fR) with the hotkey and all occurrences
of the command replacement string (\fB-C\fR) with the filename of
a temporary file containing the contents of the command for the
keybind permutation.\&
.P
.RE
-has \fIname\fR
.RS 4
True if the key \fIname\fR is in the metadata of the keybind.\&
.RE
-has \fIname\fR = \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
True if the value of \fIname\fR is exactly \fIvalue\fR.\&  Whitespace is
significant before and after the "=".\&
.RE
-has \fIname\fR !\&= \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
True if the value of \fIname\fR is \fBnot\fR \fIvalue\fR.\&  Whitespace is
significant before and after the "!\&=".\&
.RE
\fBNOTE ON GREEDINESS\fR: \fB-has\fR consumes more than one argument \fIonly\fR if the next argument cannot possibly be interpreted as another predicate or as a logical operator.\&  That is, \fB-has\fR consumes three arguments if the argument after \fIname\fR:
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'1.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 1. 4
.\}
does not start with \fB-\fR (predicate); and
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'2.\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP 2. 4
.\}
is not exactly \fB!\&\fR (negation), \fB(\fR, or \fB)\fR (grouping).\&

.RE
.P
-in \fIpath\fR
.br
-child-of \fIpath\fR
.RS 4
True if the keybind is a (direct) child of the section referred
to by \fIpath\fR.\&  An empty \fIpath\fR is forbidden.\&
.RE
-under \fIpath\fR
.br
-descendant-of \fIpath\fR
.RS 4
True if the keybind is a descendant (but not a direct child) of
the section referred to by \fIpath\fR.\&  An empty \fIpath\fR is forbidden.\&
.RE
\fIpath\fR is an absolute or relative UNIX path and can have the directory
separators escaped, i.\&e.\&, \fB/foo\\/bar/baz\fR has section \fBbaz\fR underneath
the top-level \fBfoo/bar\fR, but \fBfoo\\/bar/baz\fR has section \fBbaz\fR underneath
a section \fBfoo/bar\fR which may or may not be at the top-level.\&
.P
.SS OPERATORS
.P
Listed in order of decreasing precedence, with the same meaning as those
in \fBfind\fR(1):
.P
( \fIexpr\fR )
.P
!\& \fIexpr\fR
.P
\fIexpr1\fR -a \fIexpr2\fR
.br
\fIexpr1\fR \fIexpr2\fR
.P
\fIexpr1\fR -o \fIexpr2\fR
.P
.SH EXIT STATUS
.P
Similarly to \fBfind\fR(1), \fBhkfind\fR exits with status 0 if no errors occur,
greater than 0 if any do.\&
