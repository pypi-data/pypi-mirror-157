# Dash Charlotte

A package of themes, tools and components for Plotly-Dash web dashboards.

**TL;DR:** This is a personal project, so I'd suggest not taking this too seriously.

## Dash Charlotte is...

- ... a package to speed up the creation of dashboards with standardized components;
- ... a bunch of components that I often use on my personal projects.

## Dash Charlotte is NOT...

- ... ready for production use. The structure, arguments or behavior of the components are not set in stone and change regularly depending on the ease of use observed in testing;
- ... created in React (yet). Because of this, some components might not follow Dash rules and standards.
