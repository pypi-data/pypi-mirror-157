# altv-python-stubs

# What is this?
This is a file to allow autocomplete for the alt:V Python Module. A manual approach was chosen for this because the autogenerated ones were not great. Based on [alt:V Types](https://github.com/altmp/altv-types).

# Installation
```
$ pip install altv-stubs
```
