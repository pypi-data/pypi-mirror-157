class Challenge:

    Representation of a challenge. A challenge represent the user's Captcha
    question-answer he must face.

    This class takes cares of:
        - Generating the captcha
        - Verify inputs
        - Manage the "Captcha" object

    It frees your mind from managing all the process of a captcha challenge, keeping
    your code short and easy.

    .. py:property:: code
        :type: str

        The raw code of the Challenge.

    .. py:property:: allowed_retries
        :type: int

        The number of allowed retries.

    .. py:property:: failures
        :type: int

        The number of failures the user has realized.

    .. py:property:: attempted_tries
        :type: int

        The number of tries the user has attempted. (Or how many time was ``.begin`` called)

    .. py:property:: state
        :type: discapty.States

        The current state of the challenge.

    .. py:property:: fail_reason
        :type: str

        The reason why the challenge has failed. Only filled if the state is failed or failure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    generator : Generator
        The generator class to use.
        You cannot uses :py:obj:`discapty.generators.Generator`
        directly, you have to subclass it and implement the "generate" function first.

    challenge_id : Optional[int | str]
        The id of the challenge. Can be a string or an id.
        If none is supplied, a random `UUID`_ will be generated.

    allowed_retries : Optional[int]
        The number of retries allowed. Defaults to 3.

    code : Optional[str]
        The code to use. If none is supplied, a random code will be generated.

    code_length : int
        The length of the code to generate if no code is supplied. Defaults to 4.
