Metagenomic Intra-Species Diversity Analysis ([MIDAS](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/11/1612)) is an integrated pipeline for profiling strain-level genomic variations in shotgun metagenomic data. The standard MIDAS workflow harnesses a reference database of 5,926 species extracted from 30,000 genomes (MIDAS DB v1.2).

MIDAS2 used the same analysis workflow as the original [MIDAS tool](https://github.com/snayfach/MIDAS), and is engineered to work with more comprehensive MIDAS Reference Databases (MIDASDBs), and to run on  collections of thousands of samples in a fast and scalable manner.

MIDAS2 user manual is available at [ReadTheDocs](https://midas2.readthedocs.io/en/latest).
