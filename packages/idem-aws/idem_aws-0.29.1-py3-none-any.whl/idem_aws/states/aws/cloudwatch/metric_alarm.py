    Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with the specified metric, metric math expression, or anomaly
    detection model.Alarms based on anomaly detection models cannot have Auto Scaling actions. When this operation
    creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to INSUFFICIENT_DATA . The alarm is then evaluated and its
    state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed. When you update an
    existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration
    of the alarm. If you are an IAM user,
    you must have Amazon EC2 permissions for some alarm operations:
        * The iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole for all alarms with EC2 actions
        * The iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole to create an alarm with Systems Manager OpsItem actions.
    The first time you create an alarm in the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the CLI, or by using the
    PutMetricAlarm API, CloudWatch creates the necessary service-linked role for you. The service-linked roles are
    called AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents and AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchAlarms_ActionSSM.

    Args:
        name(Text): The name for the alarm. This name must be unique within the Region.
        resource_id(Text): The AWS name of the metric alarm.
        alarm_description(Text, Optional): The description for the alarm.
        actions_enabled(Boolean, Optional): Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the alarm
            state. The default is TRUE .
        ok_actions(List, Optional): The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to an OK state from any other state.
            Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

        INSUFFICIENT_DATA state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
            Valid Values:

                arn:aws:swf:*region* :*account-id* :action/actions/AWS_EC2.InstanceId.Reboot/1.0
        metric_name(Text, Optional): The name for the metric associated with the alarm. For each PutMetricAlarm operation,
            you must specify either MetricName or a Metrics array.
        namespace(Text, Optional): The namespace for the metric associated specified in MetricName .
        statistic(Text, Optional): The statistic for the metric specified in MetricName , other than percentile. For
            percentile statistics, use ExtendedStatistic . When you call PutMetricAlarm and specify a MetricName ,
            you must specify either Statistic or ExtendedStatistic, but not both.
        extended_statistic(Text, Optional): The percentile statistic for the metric specified in MetricName . Specify a value
            between p0.0 and p100. When you call PutMetricAlarm and specify a MetricName , you must specify either
            Statistic or ExtendedStatistic, but not both.
        dimensions(List, Optional): The dimensions for the metric specified in MetricName. A dimension is a name/value pair that
            is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are
            part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your
            metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric.
            * (Name): The name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only ASCII characters, must include at
                least one non-whitespace character, and cannot start with a colon (:).
            * (Value): The value of the dimension. Dimension values must contain only ASCII characters and must include
                at least one non-whitespace character.
        period(Integer): The length, in seconds, used each time the metric specified in MetricName is evaluated.
            Valid values are 10, 30, and any multiple of 60.
        unit(Text, Optional): The unit of measure for the statistic. For example, the units for the Amazon EC2 NetworkIn metric are
            Bytes because NetworkIn tracks the number of bytes that an instance receives on all network interfaces.
            You can also specify a unit when you create a custom metric. Units help provide conceptual meaning to your
            data. Metric data points that specify a unit of measure, such as Percent, are aggregated separately.
        evaluation_periods(Integer): The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold.
            If you are setting an alarm that requires that a number of consecutive data points be breaching to trigger
            the alarm, this value specifies that number. If you are setting an "M out of N" alarm, this value is the N.
            An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one day, so this number multiplied by
            Period cannot be more than 86,400 seconds.

        datapoints_to_alarm(Integer, Optional): The number of data points that must be breaching to trigger the alarm.
            This is used only if you are setting an "M out of N" alarm. In that case, this value is the M.
        threshold(float, optional): The value against which the specified statistic is compared.  This parameter is required for
            alarms based on static thresholds, but should not be used for alarms based on anomaly detection models.
        comparison_operator(Text): The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and
            threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first operand.
            The values LessThanLowerOrGreaterThanUpperThreshold , LessThanLowerThreshold , and
            GreaterThanUpperThreshold are used only for alarms based on anomaly detection models.
        treat_missing_data(Text, Optional): Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. If TreatMissingData is
            omitted, the default behavior of missing is used.
            Valid Values: breaching | notBreaching | ignore | missing
        evaluate_low_sample_count_percentile(Text, Optional): Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If you specify ignore ,
            the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data points to be statistically significant.
            If you specify evaluate or omit this parameter, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly changes state
            no matter how many data points are available.
        metrics(List, optional): An array of MetricDataQuery structures that enable you to create an alarm based on the result of
            a metric math expression. For each PutMetricAlarm operation, you must specify either MetricName
            or a Metrics array. Each item in the Metrics array either retrieves a metric or performs a math
            expression. One item in the Metrics array is the expression that the alarm watches. You
            designate this expression by setting ReturnData to true for this object in the array. For more
            information, see MetricDataQuery. If you use the Metrics parameter, you cannot include the
            MetricName, Dimensions, Period, Namespace, Statistic, or ExtendedStatistic parameters of
            PutMetricAlarm in the same operation. Instead, you retrieve the metrics you are using in your
            math expression as part of the Metrics array. Defaults to None.
            * (Id): A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique
                within a single call to GetMetricData. If you are performing math expressions on this set of
                data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression.
                The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a
                lowercase letter.
            * (MetricStat, optional): The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if
                this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data. Within
                one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.
            * (Expression, optional): This field can contain either a Metrics Insights query, or a metric math expression to be
                performed on the returned data. For more information about Metrics Insights queries, see Metrics
                Insights query components and syntax in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. A math expression can
                use the Id of the other metrics or queries to refer to those metrics, and can also use the Id of
                other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math
                expressions, see Metric Math Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. Within
                each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.
            * (Label, optional): A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an
                expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in
                a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a
                default. You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more
                information, see Using Dynamic Labels.
            * (ReturnData, optional): When used in GetMetricData, this option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data
                values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not
                also need the raw data returned, you can specify False. If you omit this, the default of True is
                used. When used in PutMetricAlarm, specify True for the one expression result to use as the
                alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same PutMetricAlarm operation, specify
                ReturnData as False.
            * (Period, optional): The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a
                period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-
                resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1,
                5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a
                PutMetricData operation that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second.
            * (AccountId, optional): The ID of the account where the metrics are located, if this is a cross-account alarm. Use this
                field only for PutMetricAlarm operations. It is not used in GetMetricData operations.
        threshold_metric_id(Text, Optional): If this is an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, make this value match the
            ID of the ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND function.
        tags(List or Dict, Optional): A List of tags in the format of [{"Key": tag-key, "Value": tag-value}] or dict in the format of
            {tag-key: tag-value} to associate with the alarm. You can associate as many as 50 tags with
            an alarm. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to
            scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with
            certain tag values. If you are using this operation to update an existing alarm, any tags you
            specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an existing alarm, use TagResource
            or UntagResource. Defaults to None.
            * (Key): A string that you can use to assign a value. The combination of tag keys and values can help you
                organize and categorize your resources.
            * (Value): The value for the specified tag key.
