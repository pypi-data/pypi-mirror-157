### JSON:API - Related Data, Filtering, Sorting, Pagination, Swagger
Your API is instantly ready to support ui and integration
development, available in swagger, as shown below.  JSON:APIs are interesting because they
are client configurable to **reduce network traffic** and **minimize organizational dependencies.**

The creation process builds not only the API, but swagger so you can explore it.  The Admin App Home page provides a link to the swagger, but it doesn't work in VS Code's simple browser.  So, we'll launch a new Simple Browser, like this:

1. Click __View > Command__ to open the Command Palette
   * Enter command: `Simple Browser: Show`
   * Specify the URL: `http://localhost:5656/api`
2. Explore the swagger
   * Note: you can drag windows to arrange your viewing area
3. (Leave the swagger and server running)

  > **Key Take-away:** instant *rich* APIs, with filtering, sorting, pagination and swagger.  **Custom App Dev is unblocked.**
