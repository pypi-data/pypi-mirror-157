While you will probably want to run it from your IDE (see next section), you can also run from the command line as described below.

__1. Start the Server__
The `api_logic_server_run.py` file is executable.  The simplest way to run it is:
```
ApiLogicServer run        # in Docker Terminal, or with venv active
```

__2. Open in your Browser__
The server should start, and suggest the URL for your Browser.  That will open a page like this where you can explore your data using the automatically created [Admin app](../Working-with-the-Admin-App), and explore the API with automatically generated Swagger:
