You can install API Logic Server locally using `pip`, using Docker, or pythonanywhere (a cloud service).

  > While `pip` is a simple install, it requires a Python environment, which is _not_ so simple.  We therefore recommend you consider Docker - it's a simpler install, and aligns you with a likely deployment environment.
