# Customize

The creation process does _not_ create hundreds of lines of JavaScript and HTML.  

Instead, it creates an _application __model__,_ represented in the ```admin.yaml``` file.  So, you can customize it easily, without requiring extensive JavaScript/HTML background, or deciphering generated code.

Please see [Working with the Admin App](../Working-with-the-Admin-App).
