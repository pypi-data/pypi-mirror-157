        Dynast is a command-line pipeline that preprocesses data from metabolic labeling scRNA-seq experiments and quantifies the following four mRNA species: unlabeled unspliced, unlabeled spliced, labeled unspliced and labeled spliced. In addition, dynast can perform statistical estimation of these species through expectation maximization (EM) and Bayesian inference.
        
        ### Key features
        * Complete quantification of labeling and splicing of RNA.
            * Unlabeled unspliced, unlabeled spliced, labeled unspliced, labeled spliced species quantification.
            * Highly paralellized and optimized pipeline procedures.
        * Statistical estimation procedure that corrects the observed unlabeled and labeled counts via a Bayesian inference framework.
