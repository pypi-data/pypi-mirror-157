This\npage is mainly intended for developers. Documentation for users is available\n[here](https://sbozzolo.github.io/kuibit).\n\n### Quick links\n\n- [Official documentation](https://sbozzolo.github.io/kuibit)\n- [Tutorials](https://sbozzolo.github.io/kuibit/#tutorials)\n- [Examples](https://sbozzolo.github.io/kuibit/#examples)\n- [Archive with most recent examples and tools](https://github.com/sbozzolo/kuibit/releases/latest/download/examples.tar.gz)\n- [Changelog](https://github.com/Sbozzolo/kuibit/releases)\n- [What people say about kuibit](https://sbozzolo.github.io/kuibit/testimonials.html)\n- [Users/developers group chat](https://t.me/kuibit)\n\n\n## Installation\n\n``kuibit`` is available in PyPI. To install it with `pip`\n``` bash\npip3 install kuibit\n```\nIf they are not already available, `pip` will install all the necessary dependencies.\n\nThe minimum version of Python required is 3.6.1.\n\nIf you intend to develop ``kuibit``, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and\nfollow the instruction below.\n\n### Development\n\nFor development, we use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Poetry simplifies\ndependency management, building, and publishing the package.\n\nTo install `kuibit` with poetry, clone this repo, move into the folder, and run:\n``` sh\npoetry install -E full\n```\nThis will download all the needed dependencies in a sandboxed environment (the\n`-E full` flag is for the optional dependencies). When you want to use\n``kuibit``, just run ``poetry shell`` from within the `kuibit` directory.\nThis will drop you in a shell in\nwhich you have full access to ``kuibit`` in "development" version, and its\ndependencies (including the one needed only for development). Alternatively, you\ncan activate the virtual environment directly. You can find where the environment\nin installed running the command `poetry env info --path` in the `kuibit` directory.\nThis is a standard virtual environment, which can be activated with the `activate`\nscripts in the `bin` folder. Once you do that, you will be able to use `kuibit`\nfor anywhere.\n\nAs of version `1.3.0`, we adopt the following  philosophy for `git` branches:\n- `master` always corresponds to the latest stable version, the one available on\n  PyPI. Hotfixes are applied directly on master, and a new release is tagged.\n- `next` is where most of the development occurs. This corresponds to the next\n  version of `kuibit`. `next` often experiences rebasing.\n- Specific features that can be developed on their separate feature branch. This\n  will be merged into `next`.\n\nThe documentation of the development version is served at\n[sbozzolo.github.io/kuibit/dev](https://sbozzolo.github.io/kuibit/dev).\n\n## Help!\n\nUsers and developers of ``kuibit`` meet in the [Telegram\ngroup](https://t.me/kuibit). If you have any problem or suggestion, that\'s a\ngood place where to discuss it. Alternatively, you can also open an issue on\nGitHub.\n\n## Documentation\n\n`kuibit` uses Sphinx to generate the documentation. To produce the documentation\n```sh\ncd docs && make html\n```\nDocumentation is automatically generated after each commit by GitHub Actions.\n\nWe use [nbsphinx](https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/) to translate Jupyter\nnotebooks to the examples. The extension is required. Note: Jupyter notebooks\nhave to be un-evaluated. `nbsphinx` requires [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). If\ndon\'t have `pandoc`, you should comment out `nbsphinx` in `docs/conf.py`, or\ncompiling the documentation will fail.\n\n## Videos\n\nHere is a list of videos describing `kuibit` and how to use it:\n- [Introduction on kuibit - Einstein Toolkit Seminar, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-F2xh-m31A)\n- [Using kuibit](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIVVtc6RlFxpi3BiF6KTWd3z4TTQ5hY06)\n- [kuibit - Einstein Toolkit Summer School, 2021](https://youtu.be/g-JlXfLvUZU)\n\nThe [Using\nkuibit](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIVVtc6RlFxpi3BiF6KTWd3z4TTQ5hY06)\nseries is a great place where to get started with `kuibit`.\n\n## Tests\n\n`kuibit` comes with a suite of unit tests. To run the tests, (in a poetry shell),\n```sh\npoetry run python -m unittest\n```\nTests are automatically run after each commit by GitHub Actions.\n\nIf you want to look at the coverage of your tests, run (in a poetry shell)\n```sh\ncoverage run -m unittest\ncoverage html\n```\nThis will produce a directory with the html files containing the analysis of\nthe coverage of the tests.\n\n## What is a _kuibit_?\n\nA kuibit (also known as _kukuipad_, meaning harvest pole) is the tool\ntraditionally used by the Tohono O\'odham people to reach the fruit of the\nSaguaro cacti during the harvesting season. In the same way, this package is a\ntool that you can use to collect the fruit of your `Cactus` simulations.\n\n## Credits\n\n`kuibit` follows the same design and part of the implementation details of\n`PostCactus`, code developed by Wolfgang Kastaun. This fork completely rewrites\nthe original code, adding emphasis on documentation, testing, and extensibility.\nThe logo contains elements designed by [freepik.com](freepik.com). We thank\n``kuibit`` first users, Stamatis Vretinaris and Pedro Espino, for providing\ncomments to improve the code and the documentation.\n\n## Citation\n\n`kuibit` is built and maintained by the dedication of one graduate student. Please,\nconsider citing `kuibit` if you find the software useful. You can use the following\n`bibtex` key (as provided by ADSABS).\n``` bibtex\n@article{kuibit,\n       author = {{Bozzola}, Gabriele},\n        title = "{kuibit: Analyzing Einstein Toolkit simulations with Python}",\n      journal = {The Journal of Open Source Software},\n     keywords = {numerical relativity, Python, Einstein Toolkit, astrophysics, Cactus, General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology, Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena},\n         year = 2021,\n        month = apr,\n       volume = {6},\n       number = {60},\n          eid = {3099},\n        pages = {3099},\n          doi = {10.21105/joss.03099},\narchivePrefix = {arXiv},\n       eprint = {2104.06376},\n primaryClass = {gr-qc},\n       adsurl = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JOSS....6.3099B},\n      adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}\n}\n```\nYou can find this entry in Python with `from kuibit import __bibtex__`.\n\n`kuibit` is built with `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `h5py`, and optionally uses\n`matplotlib`, `mayavi`, and `numba`. Consider citing these packages too.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n`kuibit` is developed as professional tool that can be used for research to be\npublished in peer-reviewed journals. As such, `kuibit` is tested to ensure that\nresults are scientifically sound. However, we do not guarantee that the entirety\nof the software is correct and does what it is intended to do. Hence, users are\nstrongly recommended to perform their independent validations and to report any\nproblem.\n\n',
