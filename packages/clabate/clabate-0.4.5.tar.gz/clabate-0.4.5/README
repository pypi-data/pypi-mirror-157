Clabate: minimalistic class-based templates for Python.

Clabate is a minimalistic template system for Python language.
It utilizes python class hierarchy, class attributes, and PEP 3101 string formatting.

The basic Template class can be used for bare textual templates, such as configuration files.

For markup, Clabate escapes everything by default, helping to avoid overlooked unescaped substitutions
as much as possible.

You can find more or less comprehensive examples under clabate/examples which is also a simple test suite.
