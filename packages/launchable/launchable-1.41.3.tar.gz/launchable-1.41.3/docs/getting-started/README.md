# Getting started

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
Before beginning, [contact our customer success team](https://www.launchableinc.com/contact-for-poc) to initiate an enterprise proof of concept (POC), or [sign up](https://app.launchableinc.com/signup) directly from our website. (Launchable is free for open source projects.)
{% endhint %}

The Launchable CLI connects your CI pipeline with Launchable. To get started,

1. sign up for Launchable
2. install the CLI as part of your CI script,
3. set your Launchable API key, and
4. verify connectivity

Then follow the instructions for your test runner or build tool to [send data to Launchable](../sending-data-to-launchable/).

## Sign up for Launchable

Sign up at [app.launchableinc.com/signup](https://app.launchableinc.com/signup). You'll create a user account, an [organization.md](../concepts/organization.md "mention"), and a [workspace.md](../concepts/workspace.md "mention").

## Create and set your API key

Once you've created a [workspace.md](../concepts/workspace.md "mention") for your test suite, create an API key in the **Settings** area. This authentication token allows the CLI to talk to your Launchable workspace.

Then, make this API key available as the `LAUNCHABLE_TOKEN` environment variable in your CI process. How you do this depends on your CI system:

## Add the Launchable CLI to your CI pipeline

The Launchable CLI is a Python3 package that you can install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/launchable/). The CLI connects your build tool/test runner to Launchable.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The CLI requires both **Python 3.5+** _and_ **Java 8+**.
{% endhint %}

You can install the CLI in your CI pipeline by adding this to the part of your CI script where you install dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install --user --upgrade launchable~=1.0
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you use pytest or nosetests, you don't need to use the Launchable CLI! We offer native plugins for those test runners. Check out the [pytest](../resources/integrations/pytest.md) and [nose](../resources/integrations/nose.md) pages for more info.
{% endhint %}

## Verify connectivity

After setting your API key, you can add `launchable verify || true` to your CI script to verify connectivity. If successful, you should receive an output such as:

```bash
$ launchable verify || true

Organization: <organization name>
Workspace: <workspace name>
Platform: <platform>
Python version: <version>
Java command: <command>
launchable version: <version>
Your CLI configuration is successfully verified ðŸŽ‰
```

If you get an error, see [Troubleshooting](../resources/troubleshooting.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend including `|| true` so that the exit status from the command is always `0`.
{% endhint %}

## Next steps

Now that you've connected your Launchable workspace to your CI pipeline, you can start [sending data to Launchable](../sending-data-to-launchable/) to analyze and optimize your test runs.
