    'long_description': '# PreTeXt-CLI\n\nA package for authoring and building [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org) documents.\n\n- GitHub: <https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext-cli/>\n\n## Documentation and examples for authors/publishers\n\nMost documentation for PreTeXt authors and publishers is available at:\n\n- <https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/>\n\nAuthors and publishers may also find the examples catalog useful as well:\n\n- <https://pretextbook.org/examples.html>\n\nWe have a few notes below (TODO: publish these in the Guide).\n\n### Installation\n\n#### Installing Python\n\nPreTeXt-CLI requires the Python version specified in `pyproject.toml`.\n\nTo check your version, type this into your terminal or command prompt:\n\n```\npython -V\n```\n\nIf your version is 2.x, try this instead\n(and if so, either replace all future references to `python`\nin these instructions with `python3`).\n\n```\npython3 -V\n```\n\nIf you don\'t have a compatible Python available, try one of these:\n\n- https://www.python.org/downloads/\n  - Windows warning: Be sure to select the option adding Python to your Path.\n- https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation (Mac/Linux)\n- https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#installation (Windows)\n\n#### Installing PreTeXt-CLI\n\nOnce you\'ve confirmed that you\'re using a valid version of Python, just\nrun (replacing `python` with `python3` if necessary):\n\n```\npython -m pip install --user pretextbook\n```\n\n(It\'s also possible you may get an error like \n`error: invalid command \'bdist_wheel\'`\n— good news, you can ignore it!)\n\nAfter installation, try to run:\n\n```\npretext --help\n```\n\nIf that works, great! Otherwise, it likely means that Python packages\naren\'t available on your “PATH”. In that case, replace all `pretext`\ncommands with `python -m pretext` instead:\n\n```\npython -m pretext --help\n```\n\nEither way, you\'re now ready to use the CLI, the `--help` option will explain how to use all the different\nsubcommands like `pretext new` and `pretext build`.\n\n#### Upgrading PreTeXt-CLI\nIf you have an existing installation and you want to upgrade to a more recent version, you can run:\n\n```\npython -m pip install --upgrade pretextbook\n```\n\n#### Custom XSL\n\nCustom XSL is not encouraged for most authors, but (for example) developers working\nbleeding-edge XSL from core PreTeXt may want to call XSL different from that\nwhich is shipped with a fixed version of the CLI. This may be accomplished by\nadding an `<xsl/>` element to your target with a relative (to `project.ptx`) or\nabsolute path to the desired XSL. *(Note: this XSL must only import\nother XSL files in the same directory or within subdirectories.)*\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n<target name="html">\n  <format>html</format>\n  <source>source/main.ptx</source>\n  <publication>publication/publication.ptx</publication>\n  <output-dir>output/html</output-dir>\n  <xsl>../pretext/xsl/pretext-html.xsl</xsl>\n</target>\n```\n\nIf your custom XSL file needs to import the XSL\nshipped with the CLI (e.g. `pretext-common.xsl`), then use a `./core/`\nprefix in your custom XSL\'s `xsl:import@href` as follows:\n\n```\n<xsl:import href="./core/pretext-common.xsl"/>\n```\n\nSimilarly, `entities.ent` may be used:\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE xsl:stylesheet [\n    <!ENTITY % entities SYSTEM "./core/entities.ent">\n    %entities;\n]>\n```\n\n*Note: previously this was achieved with a `pretext-href` attribute - this is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.*\n\n---\n\n## Development\n**Note.** The remainder of this documentation is intended only for those interested\nin contributing to the developement of this project.  Anyone who simply wishes to\n*use* the PreTeXt-CLI can stop reading here. \n\nFrom the "Clone or Download" button on GitHub, copy the `REPO_URL` into the below\ncommand to clone the project.\n\n```bash\ngit clone [REPO_URL]\ncd pretext-cli\n```\n\n### Using a valid Python installation\n\nDevelopers and contributors must install a\nversion of Python that matching the requirements in `pyproject.toml`.\n\n#### Using pyenv and poetry (Mac/Linux)\n\nThe `pyenv` tool for Linux automates the process of running the correct\nversion of Python when working on this project (even if you have\nother versions of Python installed on your system).\n\n- https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation\n\nRun the following, replacing `PYTHON_VERSION` with your desired version.\n\n```\npyenv install PYTHON_VERSION\n```\n\nThen follow these instructions to install `poetry`.\n\n- https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation\n    - Note 2022/06/21: you may ignore "This installer is deprecated". See\n      [python-poetry/poetry/issues/4128](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4128)\n\nThen you should be able to install dependencies into a virtual environment\nwith this command.\n\n```\npoetry install\n```\n\nThen to use the in-development package, you can either enter a poetry shell:\n\n```\npretext --version # returns system version\npoetry shell\npretext --version # returns version being developed\nexit\npretext --version # returns system version\n```\n\nOr use the runner (as long as you remain within the package directory):\n\n```\npretext --version             # returns system version\npoetry run pretext --version  # returns version being developed\n```\n\nIf you run `echo \'alias pr="poetry run"\' >> ~/.bashrc` then restart your\nshell, this becomes less of a mouthful:\n\n```\npretext --version     # returns system version\npr pretext --version  # returns version being developed\n```\n\n#### Steps on Windows\n\nIn windows, you can either use the bash shell and follow the directions above,\nor try [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#installation).  In\nthe latter case, make sure to follow all the installation instructions, including\nthe **Finish the installation**.  Then proceed to follow the directions above to\ninstall a version of python matching `.pyproject.toml`.  Finally, you may then need\nto manually add that version of python to your path.\n\n### Updating dependencies\n\nTo add dependencies for the package, run\n\n```\npoetry add DEPENDENCY-NAME\n```\n\nIf someone else has added a dependency:\n\n```\npoetry install\n```\n\n### Syncing untracked updates\n\nUpdates to certain files tracked to the repository will\nneed to be rebuilt by each user when pulled from GitHub.\n\nThe file `pretext/__init__.py` tracks the upstream\ncommit of core PreTeXt XSL/Python code we\'re developing against\n(from `PreTeXtBook/pretext`).\nTo grab these updates from upstream, run:\n\n```\npoetry run python scripts/update_core.py\n```\n\nIf you instead want to point to a local copy of `PreTeXtBook/pretext`,\ntry this instead to set up symlinks:\n\n```\npoetry run python scripts/symlink_core.py path/to/pretext\n```\n\nUpdates to `templates/` must be zipped and moved into\n`pretext/static/templates`. This is done automatically by\nrunning:\n\n```\npoetry run python scripts/zip_templates.py\n```\n\n### Packaging\n\nTo check if a successful build is possible:\n\n```\npoetry run python scripts/build_package.py\n```\n\nTo publish a new alpha release, first add/commit any changes. Then\nthe following handles bumping versions, publishing to PyPI,\nand associated Git management.\n\n```\npoetry run python scripts/release_alpha.py\n```\n\nPublishing a stable release is similar:\n\n```\npoetry run python scripts/release_stable.py # patch +0.+0.+1\npoetry run python scripts/release_stable.py minor # +0.+1.0\npoetry run python scripts/release_stable.py major # +1.0.0\n```\n\n---\n\n## About\n\n### PreTeXt-CLI Lead Developers\n- [Steven Clontz](https://clontz.org/)\n- [Oscar Levin](https://math.oscarlevin.com/)\n\n### About PreTeXt\nThe development of [PreTeXt\'s core](https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext)\nis led by [Rob Beezer](http://buzzard.ups.edu/).\n',
