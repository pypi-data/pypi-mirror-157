This package\nclosely follows the general framework of inter-rater reliability assessment\npresented by Gwet (2014).\n\nThe functionality covers calculations for various chance-corrected agreement\ncoefficients (CAC) among 2 or more raters. Among the CAC coefficients covered\nare Cohen\'s kappa, Conger\'s kappa, Fleiss\' kappa, Brennan-Prediger coefficient,\nGwet\'s AC1/AC2 coefficients, and Krippendorff\'s alpha. Multiple sets of weights\nare proposed for computing weighted analyses.\n\nThe functions included in this package can handle 2 types of input data. Those\ntypes with the corresponding coefficients are in the following list:\n\n1. Contingency Table\n\n  1. Brennar-Prediger\n  2. Cohen\'s kappa\n  3. Gwet AC1/AC2\n  4. Krippendorff\'s Alpha\n  5. Percent Agreement\n  6. Schott\'s Pi\n\n2. Raw Data\n\n  1. Fleiss\' kappa\n  2. Gwet AC1/AC2\n  3. Krippendorff\'s Alpha\n  4. Conger\'s kappa\n  5. Brennar-Prediger\n\n.. note::\n   All of these statistical procedures are described in details in\n   Gwet, K.L. (2014,ISBN:978-0970806284):\n   "Handbook of Inter-Rater Reliability," 4th edition, Advanced Analytics, LLC.\n\n   This package is a port *(with permission)* to Python of the\n   `irrCAC <https://github.com/kgwet/irrCAC>`_ library for R by Gwet, K.L.\n\n.. important::\n   This is a **work in progress** and *does not* have (yet) the full\n   functionality found in the R library.\n\nInstallation\n------------\nTo install the package, run:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install irrCAC\n\nDevelopers\n----------\nTo run the tests, install `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ and run:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    poetry install\n\nNext run:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    poetry run pytest\n\nThere is also a config file for `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_\nso you can automatically run the tests for various python versions like this:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    tox\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nThe documentation of the project is available at the following page:\nhttp://irrcac.readthedocs.io/\n',
