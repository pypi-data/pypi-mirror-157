Added implementation for *editable install* hooks (PEP 660) - **beta** stage.

- The user will be able select between two distinct behaviors:

  - *lax*, which prioritises the ability of the users of changing the
    distributed packages (e.g. adding new files or removing old ones)

  - *strict*, which will try to replicate as much as possible the behavior of
    the package as if it would be normally installed by end users.
    The *strict* editable installation is not able to detect if files are
    added or removed from the project (a new installation is required).

.. important::
   The *editable* aspect of the *editable install* supported this implementation
   is restricted to the Python modules contained in the distributed package.
   Changes in binary extensions (e.g. C/C++), entry-point definitions,
   dependencies, metadata, datafiles, etc require a new installation.
